""La casa de papel"" (""Money Heist"" in English) is a series that you just gotta see.

2,searchanddestroy-1,What a mess!!!!,1/10,13 June 2018,"I expected far better than this. This Tv series is far too long, too much ""fat"", useless moments and characters, the playing is awful, unbelievable at the most, and this TV show is not brutal, not bloody enough for this kind of subject, of scheme. The producers intended to involve the largest audiences possible. Home audiences, the whole family. This brought cheesy situations, for sissies. NOT FOR ME. But I admit that there are good story lines, in the basic scheme, I mean, and interesting situations. But the whole is jeopardized by this non sense destined, I repeat, for the largest audiences possible.

3,grantss,"Clever and intriguing, initially, but gets dumber and dumber the longer it goes on",5/10,9 January 2019,"A band of robbers, lead by a man known simply as 'the Professor', infiltrate and rob the Spanish National Mint. They appear to bungle it, ending up holed up in the Mint with 67 hostages. But it's all part of the Professor's plan. If it succeeds, they'll make off with over $2 billion Euros.Entertaining, initially, and could have been a masterpiece. The initial plot - the plan to secure the Mint and make off with over $2 billion Euros - was very clever and intriguing. It was also engaging: you got to know the individual characters of the heisters, as well as who they were up against. From here on I expected a taught, gritty battle of wits and wills between the robbers and the police.Unfortunately, that didn't happen. Instead of being tight, the plot diverged into silly escapades. One escapade lead to another: robber has to fix some error, fixes it, unwittingly causes another issue, now has to fix that, rinse and repeat. What's worse, the errors, solutions and escapades were incredibly implausible, just being antics for action sake.In addition, having established their characters in the first few episodes, the robbers then do several things counter to their characters. It was as if the writers wrote each scene independent of what had happened before. It could not have been more random if they brought in a different writer for each episode, and told them not to read the scripts of the previous episodes.The further into the series one went, the worse it got. During the first season the good, clever plot developments generally outweighed the random, implausible, stupid ones. By Season Two it was open season, with dumb stuff being the norm. The dumb plot developments became predictable, eg you have a situation where a character has a choice and the logical thing, the thing people would do 100% of the time in real life, is to do A. However, A would mean the series ends, so the character does B, and the series continues.So the plot only makes sense if you're mind-bogglingly stupid.By the end I just wanted it to be over, so my intelligence would no longer be insulted. And yet it still got drawn out, by about 2-3 episodes too many.And apparently there's a Season 3 in the works. Considering how it ended, not sure how that's possible, but the producers did manage to turn what should have been a 8-or-so episode mini-series into a 2-season, 22-episode series.",Money_heist
4,deloudelouvain,Watch it in Spanish.,8/10,31 July 2020,"All my friends were talking about La Casa De Papel (I really don't get why you have to call it Money Heist) as it was the best series ever so I was really curious and excited to watch it. I waited a long time to start watching it but once I started I binge watched the first four seasons. So yes I admit it, it is addictive, you can't help to want to know what will happen in the next episode. That said the plot itself is sometimes very far fetched, in other words it would never happen like that in real life. The Professor thinks about every move the police will make, and that's fine, but sometimes it's just very unlikely and just a bit exaggerated. For that alone I can't rate this, for the rest excellent series, with a higher score. The cast is really good though, every actor did a great job, from the most annoying one to the heroes. Everyone will have their favorite character, some will die and some will survive, that what makes this show really entertaining, the not knowing what will happen. I strongly advise you watch this show in it's original language Spanish instead of watching it dubbed. It only adds to the excellent acting. I once tried to watch a dubbed thing, it's just awful, and I really don't get what people like about lips being out of synch. Can't wait for season five, let's bring it on.",Money_heist

6,pennyelenabooks,Good Enough,8/10,29 May 2019,"If you like movies like the italian job, than this show is for you. The drama doesn't really go off track when it came to presenting a well planed heist. Although there were some predictable parts, the overall result was wonderful. The performances were, as well, top notch. Another plus about this series is that the pace is well managed, so, even though the events take place during the course of a few days, the audiance doesn't fell bored. However, I do feel a bit uneasy about season three, as the heist is over after season two.",Money_heist
7,Top_Dawg_Critic,Don't forget to breathe üò± üôå,10/10,19 April 2020,"I just finished binging both seasons, parts 1-4, and wow did this show hook me in right at the first episode.Novice actors were cast and their performances were outstanding, falling sympathetic to each ones skills, flaws and unique personalities.Directing was excellent, as was the cinematography. The story concept was brilliant, and played out with non-stop tension and suspense, and all the timelines and flashbacks were executed perfectly. Aside from some plot an technical issues, with a few pacing problems in some of the episodes - especially season 2, not a minute was wasted, and I found myself forgetting to breathe with the constant drama each episode offered.Some people thought season 2 was bad, but it had its plus an minuses compared to the first season, which was stellar. The difference is more character development and dynamics, which I enjoyed, but I do agree about some of the long dragged out episodes, ridiculous and illogical action scenes, and overdone drama. However, season 3 episode 8 is one of the best episodes I've ever seen, of any show, or for that matter movie. It needs to win every award possible. I also was not a fan of the final episode of the second season. It didn't have a resolution like the first season, but instead, was left with many cliffhangers and illogical plot twists. They needed to have one or two more episodes to wrap up and give its viewers closure, instead of opening up a new season in the same heist. That was just dumb.Nevertheless, it's the best international tv series I've seen, and in my top five of all time tv shows - right up there with Breaking Bad and Ozark. It's a well deserved 9.5 rounded up to 10/10 from me. Can't wait for part 5, and I hope it's sooner than later to relieve my frustration and anger how they closed out the last season.

8,cjonesas,[9.9] Unique! Just unique...,10/10,1 July 2020,"Emotions are swirling in my head like a whirlpool, I'm speechless.. my eyes are bright with flashes of lightning, I didn't expect that.. I've never dreamed of such a masterpiece on reading its merits and then watching its four golden seasons back to back.But, here I am, shaken and in awe.
That's not a series, it's a masterpiece, it's like a living dream, a roller coaster of thrills and emotions, so intense, so vivid that you keep on living the moments with the group, with the protagonists and antagonists alike, but foremost with the group of robbers, spearheaded by the amazing and terrific Professor.Scene after scene, you come to root for them, to succeed, to make a difference, to try to change the system, to pass their message of resistance, like Robin Hood in modern times.The cast was one of the brightest cast that I've ever seen. They didn't just play and perform. They were a family. The chemistry and camaraderie between them were just amazing and oh so believable. If I could, I would congratulate them in person with tearful eyes. I, especially loved El Profesor, Berlin, Nairobi and Stockholm... Do believe that every one of the actors and actresses just shone.The screenplay, plots and sub-plots, cinematography and filming are worth tons of awards.The music and soundtrack, especially Bella Ciao alone were just memorable, rightly placed and enthralling. Loved every bit.The flow, development, pace and vibe of the show were near flawless, superb and super intense.La Casa de Papel will be remembered as a blinding diamond for many many years to come.
It is my opinion that It has set a new standard in TV shows, is a force to reckon with, while being truly unique and successful in its way of depiction and passing its message.It's a series that grabs your attention at all times until you finish it as quickly as possible, makes you enthusiastic like never before and brings unbelievable amounts of joy, excitement and thrills to your viewing experience.You will remember it for a long long time as one of the genre-defining TV shows of your existence.",Money_heist
9,cjonesas,The 100 out of 100 of my life,10/10,6 July 2021,"I already reviewed this amazing show a year ago.After a year, I return and again see the hatred towards the alleged HYPE that many viewers out there feel about La Casa de Papel.To all lovers and haters, please know, that's the only series that I would give a 100 if I could.It is that great, that amazing and that impactful.Happy binge-watching the first part of season 5 in September!

10,dierregi,Lady detective talks to mummy when going gets tough,1/10,8 March 2019,"A motley gang of criminals spend five months under the supervision of the hyper-annoying Professor, to learn how to pull off the heist of the millennium. If the premise sounds stupid, it's because it is. The Professor must possess infinite time and resources to select his gang, prepare the plan, organise the ""lessons"", rent a house in a secluded location, feed himself and the gang for months, etc...But even if you buy it - for entertainment sake - all the ""careful preparation"" turns out as a mighty waste of time, because boys and girls on both sides of the law are too busy with their hormonal tempests.All the four main female characters are engaged in illicit affairs and/or showing off plenty of flesh and lots of time is spent gazing at their buttocks. Discussing and carrying out intricate sexual cavortings soon derails the plot. Pregnancies are debated endlessly.Within 24 hours from creating a hostage situation involving over 60 people, the criminals are privy to the affair of a married guy with his secretary and talk endlessly about that, like gossiping schoolgirls.The stupidity of the dialogues is impressive.... Raquel, the lady detective in charge of negotiations, after having created a minor mess with the hostages, phones HER MUM, because she is terribly distressed, but they end up talking about a stranger Raquel is infatuated with.I am not sure if the Raquel's role was a homage to female strength, but she actually succeed in being a massive stereotype of female irrationality and weakness. Could you imagine a male counterpart talking to mum about how hard his job is?Finally, the whole plot is TOTALLY derivative: Tokyo is a bad copy of Mia, from Pulp Fiction; the criminals choosing fake names is copied from ""Reservoir Dogs""; the hostages being forced to wear overalls, from ""Inside man""... etc..PS from the enthusiastic reviews of the audience, one would think the vast majority never watched a heist movie/series before...",Money_heist
11,s3276169,Slickly sexy Spanish steal....,5/10,3 May 2018,"Slickly sexy Spanish crime drama La Casa de papel is by far and a way an absolute show stealer. I can not think of anything i have seen that comes close to this series. Its so polished its downright blinding.The first season cleverly blends a highly original and detailed tale of theft on a grand scale with sophisticated, deeply personal, character development, colourful narrative, lots of guns and sex. interestingly too for all the action to be found in this series, which include a couple of pretty decent gun fights, there is not a lot of true violence. Indeed, given the setting of this series, the body count is pretty low. Not an easy thing to do but to be honest this series feels ""lighter"" and more enjoyable for it. A refreshing departure from the blood soaked crime drama's coming out of the US in particular. I devoured the first season almost in one sitting and was left wanting much much, more. The Spanish have managed to set a new benchmark for crime drama everyone else should aspire to. 10/10 from me.",Money_heist
12,s3276169,Why season 3?,5/10,5 April 2020,"I gave season one and two of this show a much deserved 10/10 but I'm at a loss to understand why they made season 3?Season 3 is the antithesis of the former seasons. It ruins the mostly light hearted vibe that had been established, replacing it with something much darker. Worse still, its simply, in many respects, a blatant re-hash of what went before.Like Star Wars, this feels like making something for the sake of making it. I'm happy to have had the first two seasons and will be leaving it there.5/10 for season 3.

13,Luigi Di Pilla,One of the best TV-series I have ever seen,10/10,21 May 2018,"My son recommended me to see this thriller series on Netflix. Each series is written very carefully with lot of intelligent details. I mean from the human and criminal side. The elements used in this story are put very clever together in a way you want never stop watching it. It offers lot of suspense, spectacle, high emotions and another dimension to understand the criminals who want sometimes justice for their undesperated situation. Finally you enjoy the great performance from all the actors. Congratulations to all and thank you for this unforgettable present. 
If you want to spend other entertaining moments don't miss the other legendary series Breaking Bad or Narcos.
My rating 10/10.

15,Abdulxoxo,Not what it used to be,7/10,27 September 2020,"Oh my oh my, Money heist isn't totally what it used to be, S1 & S2 are great, even tho they have their faults they are masterpiece compare to S3 & s4. I agree with some people saying that it should end at S2.first, Season 3 felt like a complete replica of S1 with just one difference: gold for money
it's very greedy of the professor and his mediocre team to think about another heist when they have a lot of money, in fact, millions. so why would they want more? when will the professor realize that his heist Is complete failure? maybe after all his team are dead, 'cause so far four had died. so when will it be enough professor? till your entire team is dead?
s4 is a complete disaster, in fact it is a filler season. we will just wait for the continuation of s3 when s5 comes. Nothing happened s4 that made the actual heist plot move forward. Tokyo is a surgeon, Gandia is the T2 Terminator, Rio is a cry baby that needs to be consulted every five minutes or so, there's just too many unnecessary drama in s4. why not just killed of Nairobi after being shot, but no, they decided to recovered her then killed her off three or so episodes later, what for?ohh the flashbacks are totally out of place and have outstay their welcome, Berlin is dead just let him stay like that. some are even theorising that he might still be alive because of the flashbacks. As much as I like Nairobi, I hope they will let her dead, no flashbacks of her like Berlin. when they do that, it just makes their deaths less impactful.I really wish they had completed the 'gold heist' in S4 like they did with the 'money heist' in S2, so two seasons for each heist would have made more sense. here's hoping s5 will be better.",Money_heist
16,saadgkhan,Raquel has to be the WORST COP EVER!!!,4/10,11 January 2021,"Money Heist - Flawed but Worthy (C+)Just here to say Raquel has to be the WORST COP EVER. Within 80 hours of heist, she is galvanising with the stranger who has same similarities like the professor. Within hours knowing him, while dealing with the biggest robbery and kidnapping in the world she is bringing him to top secret places, family and then complains about why she can't find professor. Dumbest Cop EVERRR!!!The show is definitely overhyped maybe due to quick money, sexual innuendoes and robbers being portrayed as hot shots. Show has portrayed police as imbecile, emotional and fools. There is not a good cop character for viewers to root for even though they're trying to do their jobs innocent getting raped, killed and all for money.The show has it's moment but it's Fast and Furious of TV, nonsensical and stupidity is truly unrealistic. I stopped watching after season 3 episode 1, another heist geez who has the time for that and the smartest tech guy in the group gets caught due to tech thingy. It can't go dumber than this. I'm over and out!!!",Money_heist
17,MR_Heraclius,Great,10/10,2 April 2020,"I'm not really big on series, but once I started watching Money Heist I couldn't stop watching. The plot is captivating, intense, emotional, it involves all your senses and it's highly unpredictable. It's a thoroughly thought out series.
The characters are so amazing, they played their parts so well that at each point you feel so immersed like you're there with them. The professor is a genius. Berlin is a very fantastic guy, focused and principled, one of my best characters only second to the professor. Nairobi, oh my Nairobi. I can equally liken her to Berlin because she's focused on the job.If you've not watched Money Heist, I don't know what to say to you honestly.One of the best series I've seen.

19,AvionPrince16,Wonderful TV Show,8/10,23 August 2021,"Casa de Papel is a very good TV show overall. I really enjoyed it. The plan of el profesor, the narration by Tokyo, the relationship between characters. The two first seasons was very great. The third season, at the beginning, i felt that become more a fan base but when you watched it all the season it still have some great moments: mysteries, suspense, dramatic, funny, psychological moments. I recommend this Tv show. It was a very good experience overall. The season 4 have still some great moments and the end want to see the season 5 for sure.

20,AvionPrince16,Its the end,8/10,4 December 2021,"Now the final season is finished, i can talk about la casa del papel. Its a great TV Shows with some great moments: dramatic, funny, tense moments, action scenes, fantastic effects and with some lovely characters because we care for them. Im very satisfied with this TV show with the end too which i found the end very believable and i loved the way that they tried to let us think about something different at the end until the end that we understand what happened. I enjoyed all the seasons really. Maybe the third season in the beginning the TV show look very fan based. But i think in the middle part of the third seasons we can see some stuff very interesting. The season 5 was very good but i found that they developped so much some characters and the end of some relationship dont have an equal ending as a developpment. So i found some elements pretty rushed in the end but was not completely disappointed but i hoped more for example sierra and el professor but thats ok i mean. And the end what we can regret a little thats the end feel too much as an happy ending. But i can only recommend people to watch the seasons i fohnd a pretty great tv show that i wanted to watch over and over. Even if sometimes the tv show have too much spectacular scenes sometimes and it can make the audience more passive in some action scenes. But really a great TV show.",Money_heist

The second series was as if a bunch of students were given a project to redo the entire series, got drunk or high, and produced this swill.So much talking and terrible acting trying to evoke emotions but given the absolutely ridiculous plot and even worse dialogue. Fail!!!Just awful!!

24,pietclausen,Intriguing and very different,8/10,16 September 2021,"This Spanish production with English audio is very satisfying to watch. In fact it is so different from American productions, it stands in a class of its own. 'The House of Paper' in Spanish, but also meaning 'The House of Money' contains much more than a heist and it takes a couple of episodes to become really engrossed in this saga. Many people may consider binge watching this series, but it will take many days to do so.Many episodes start off with a past incident, which looks unrelated, before the show carries on with the cliffhanger from the previous episode. This interruption is annoying! Season 1 and 2 are excellent. Season 3, a year or so later, is slower in setting the final scene for season 4 and 5, completing Volume 1. Bella Ciao - Goodbye Beautiful. Fortunately volume 2 is on the cards to commence in December 2021.The last 5 episodes (volume 2) did not deliver the miracle many viewers had hoped for. Nevertheless the series comes to a satisfactory conclusion with a number of twists, although some will consider the ending as an anticlimax. This comes about as the result of writing the last episodes impromptu and filming it at the same time. Everyone chipped in and made the end happen through collaboration. It had not been planned in advance, so any goofs or bad decisions, could not be corrected. Had the miracle happened, the series would have ended on a high note!",Money_heist
25,bshaef,A Clunker with a Capital C,4/10,20 June 2019,"Improbable story, head police lady wore blouse showing half her assets, makes love to bad guy not knowing he was bad guy, voice over woman was reading from printed page at all times and in general the whole darn show just stunk but I watched it anyway. I learned a good lesson for future Netflix series/movies. It I think they stink, quite watching. Thanks for education, NetFlix. I love you anyway.",Money_heist
26,cgvsluis,I'd like to say I loved this heist show tremendously but it went on just a tad too long.,8/10,8 December 2021,"There are so many things to like in this Spanish heist series that I would like to say I loved it and give it a ten star rating...but I think it went on a tad too long. It started to have a predictable rhythm, our hero thieves would have a great victory and it would immediately be followed by a huge set back that would look like game-over for our crew....but wait our brains the professor anticipated this too and has a plan! The first time...maybe even the second time it was great drama, but then they either needed to end it or change it up.Otherwise, I felt like this was a fresh and clever heist series that I enjoyed watching in it's native Spanish (thank you, Netflix for allowing us to do that...not all Americans appreciate dubbing!).The overall story is about a group of thieves who in season one rob the royal Spanish mint. Each of our thieves uses the name of a city to keep their anonymity during the heist. The crew is run by a somewhat psychotic and chauvinistic leader on the inside...but the real leader is the brains on the outside known as ""the professor"". The story is told under the narration of my least favorite character, a young woman whose pseudonym is Tokyo. There are several timelines and a couple perspectives...the first timeline is the actual heist in real time as it is going down and the second main timeline is the entire team assembled before the heist in a seemingly abandoned manor in the countryside where they lived together for a time while being schooled by the professor as to the plan. The thieves become National heroes (all part of the plan) as it is discovered that their real plan wasn't to steal from anyone...but to print their own money and take that. There were several new and very clever tricks used to pull off their heist, including using police tactics, social media and mob mentality to cover tracks, stay the police's hands, etc. All of that was throughly enjoyable. I appreciated the cleverness and the well thought out plans...I liked that things didn't always go perfectly, like real life.I am in an argument with myself about the few things I didn't care for...like Tokyo, our completely crazy, unpredictable narrator. She brought a lot of unnecessary chaos into the mix, which I guess was good for storytelling...but I wouldn't agree to do a heist with her, too unreliable. But maybe she is just the kind of crazy person you can talk into robbing a mint? Anyway I am a little conflicted in my feelings around this character.Season one competes the first heist, seasons two and three are about a second heist...this time of The Royal Spanish Reserve, aka The Bank of Spain, in which they steal all of the Spanish Reserve gold.I can't really say anymore without giving delightful surprises away. Trust me if you like a good heist you will love this series and do not be deterred that it is in Spanish it just adds to the enjoyment and the romantic story telling.It also has a pretty great soundtrack and camaraderie feel.""Bella, Ciao.... Bella, Ciao, Bella, Ciao Ciao Ciao!""",Money_heist
27,joachimokeefe,Really bad soap opera. Worse than a school production. Not even laughable.,1/10,3 April 2020,"You know how it is on a foreign trip. You turn on the hotel TV and if you're not fluent in the language, you zone out and half-follow the picture. And then you have your typical soap opera actors - some of them can't act, but are photogenic, some of them can sort of act and aren't photogenic, and some of them are required only to pretend to be in a coma. Most of them overact (or over non-act), because the scarcity of acting work means they've never come up against a decent director who would have told them to tone it down a bit. Even the guy in a coma.Wardrobe? Red overalls, mainly. The hairdresser tried really hard, though.Then there's the script. Obviously, your series creator has got a thing about planting false clues for the forensic team, because the fact that the man with fake irritable bowel syndrome has done this in advance is the main source of suspense - you're supposed to be waiting for the CSI team to catch on. No doubt they will, when they get over their break-up issues.Then the man who doesn't have Stockholm syndrome - a syndrome from Stockholm, they explain - tries to explain to the woman who does have Stockholm syndrome (from Stockholm) that it's just not going to work out between them. Even if they go to Sweden.And then - and then - the Professor hasn't answered the phone for 24 hours. Gripping? So is duct tape. Except duct tape doesn't go on as long.Whoever wrote this junk tries to cover themselves by randomly throwing in a car crash, or a Hispanic standoff, or a completely unconvincing love scene every ten minutes, so that people who can't get off the sofa in less than ten minutes have an excuse to stop trying.I like trash TV as much as the next hombre but this is weak, derivative and not even fun. Anyone tells you it's 'unmissable' should be kept at 50m distance.",Money_heist
28,saru2020,Awaiting 5/final,6/10,16 April 2021,"Series 1: (Meh)
A concept that's made by so many people in so many different flavours, this concept was a bit unique with more engaging sequences, definitely a must-watch for those heist fans with lots of patience to watch a meagre 2 hour content over 10+ hours in a more elaborated way, maybe it takes time for the characters to get established and by end of the series, it feels like all of these characters were very close to us, which means we as audiences have got engaged very well.I personally liked the way professors' characterization who thinks from 360-degree angles, an apt one for the intelligent folks.The only disappointing thing was the climax, which didn't have anything much in-store and it simply ended up like that making us feel like having consumed a half-baked food or maybe I didn't understand what these guys had to convey, but it's just my opinion for that matter.Series 2: (Conclusion 1)
Thankfully, this series gives us the conclusion revealing a lot of interesting things about the characters and how & whether they achieved what went for.Tokyo coming back into the heist tent was the highlight in this entire series and portrayed as one.Inspector getting involved with the gang being one another twist that was less expected.Berlin's death was the very least expected.Overall, it was a good roller coaster ride with lots of twists & turn arounds.Series 3: (Tokyo starts it again)
It does feel good to see everyone coming back for a single person in the team and this one is the bigger heist than the one before.A new pregnant antagonist inspector with lots of attitudes does take this series to a whole new level as she makes up the cat & mouse game even interesting to watch.Good to watch Berlin comeback in the flashbacks in lots of scenes, this one was more like a prequel to the series 1 itself and how they initially started working on the current heist plans and then it was dropped.Also, it felt like this series was way more emotional than the previous one as the characters involved were already in relationships and all of their characterisations was already well established within us, viewers, which makes it even easier for the makers but challenging as well since it'd make feel like watching the same thing again so they've made it much more interesting than the previous one.The 2 new members do add something to this series but not quite significantly.It feels quite boring & sometimes irritating to watch Arthuro scenes, not sure why, but it wasn't fun watching him in this one.Finally, we were made to believe that Nairobi was dead and makes us wait for another series to know the truth.Series 4: (Nairobi is really gone, still didn't conclude)
It was good to see the scenes performed by Gandia where he takes control from inside and it's like a double-edged sword like thing for the team to handle with the professor also being tracked which makes us even more engaged.This series felt a bit slow with more & more slow scenes and much more emotional content than ever, which was its only Con, I believe.It felt a bit shocking to see Nairobi dead and the professor caught and the series ends without it being concluded, making us wait for another one.",Money_heist
29,tchitouniaram,Honestly...,10/10,10 October 2019,"Honestly...Once again extremely annoyed by negative reviews ...Why people feel the need to find logic in the entertainment...Looking for logic?Watch only Documentaries !!!Or sports,or music,don't judge action /thrillers negatively,just because of plot holes or whatever!!!If everything in films would be done according to real life logic.THERE WOULD BE NO ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY AND WE ALL DIED FROM BOREDOME WITHOUT MOVIES!!!
There are absolutely no TV series or ant other films,that can possibly follow the real life scenarios!!!Why??? Cause It would be very short and boring films!
Somebody holds up a bank,police arrives,shoots or arrest everybody-THE END!!!
So enjoy the art of cinematography for what it really gives you:some time to forget about miserable everyday life!And Money Heist is definitely one of the best shows in that regard!

It's annoying how greedy the producers got once they realized that they had a hit show and that it was popular. It does have it's good scenes but the first series is 16 episodes of 45 mins each, when it could have been done in 1/4 of that time.Then they got even more greedy and decided on extending it with a Season 3,4 and 5. Unreal. What's next? Weddings,funerals, charity work and maybe one of the robbers becomes the leader of Spain. Nothing is impossible in this show !

33,Azanspy,It's good but it's overrated.,7/10,3 April 2020,"Money Heist is a good watchable series. But I don't see why or how this is getting the recognition as one of the best series ever. It's not. To be honest, the series is lagging most of the episodes and picks up pace in the final episodes only. And I didn't like the Season 4 ending much too. It felt just like any other episode. The performances are not great apart from Berlin, Palermo and few others. I hate most of the characters. I'm being so pessimistic because it's getting over optimism from many others. Overall, it's a compelling watchable series.

34,bregund,Started out pretty good,6/10,30 January 2021,"I'm on the fourth season now and the story is stretching thin. The first heist was great, it made sense, it was a complete story. They're already rich, why in the world would they endanger themselves and go back and do a second heist? It makes no sense. I know they did it to ""rescue Rio"" but come on, man. Let's say you're richer than God partying it up in some remote part of the world and your former team leader needs you to go back and rescue a member of the team. It's not very realistic that they would all agree to this.I liked the characters at first, but at this point in my viewing, they are starting to suffer from Character Stupidity Syndrome, a phenomenon where the show's writers continually paint the characters into corners and the only way out is to have them react in idiotic and unrealistic ways, for example Arthur breaking his way in to the second heist, PAST A POLICE BLOCKADE. Come on. But even this isn't half as questionable as the diversity shoehorned into ""5 Minutes Earlier"" as the male characters react in astonishment to seeing a distant cousin's gender transformation...it comes off as a cheap gimmick instead of a slowly building story arc that's woven into the rest of the storyline.Despite the show's flaws, the acting is generally good, although I don't know how many more times I can watch the professor adjust his eyeglasses or Raquel react with a long, blank stare. The actress who plays Nairobi is really intense, I hope to see her in more shows or films in the future.",Money_heist
35,Supermanfan-13,Pretty Entertaining!,8/10,11 August 2021,"I've heard about how good Money Heist is since it started back in 2017 but for some reason I put off watching it. I finally gave in and started watching it recently and now I can't stop, it's every bit as good as everyone says it is. The writing and acting are both excellent, there are so many twists and surprises that it will keep you on the edge of your seat and guessing throughout the entire series! Just a little warning...once you start watching it it's hard to stop, you'll want to binge it as quickly as possible!

38,shanayneigh,Ridiculous,1/10,5 April 2020,"The first season was great, a solid 9. It was kind of a spin on Inside Man, my favorite Spike Lee movie (closely followed by Malcolm X).But already in the second season the show metaphorically jumps the shark when a character literally jumps a motorcycle. Things quickly go south from there.Season 2 had a natural ending. But of course Netflix has to keep beating that dead horse. Season 3 onward make no sense whatsoever.Characters - who are now experienced bank robbers, mind you - keep making the dumbest decisions imaginable in order to fill the run time. The professor's planning skills were a stretch already back in the first season, but by season 3-4 he must have developed superpowers. Tertiary characters are thrown into the mix without introduction whenever they write themselves into a jam and the professor is so omniscient that it reminds me of another deus ex machina device, namely ""The Company"" from another ridiculous show that went on far too long, Prison Break.The acting is for the most part over the top. Tokyo poses like she's on a runway, Denver is chewing the scenery whenever he's on the screen, and I hoped that we would finally be rid of a certain performer after season 2, but of course that performer is hamming it up again in plenty of dreadfully boring flashbacks in seasons 3-4 which seem to take up almost as much run time as the heist.But the only thing more over the top than the music and the brain dead writing is the music, which is blaring at full speed constantly. A little tip to the composer: If everything is emphasized with dramatic music, in the end nothing is emphasized. Less is more.The only reason I don't give this a lower score is because of the fantastic first and serviceable second season. Season 3-4 deserve no higher than a 3 rating.",Money_heist

40,x_manicure_x,Was not supposed to continue,5/10,24 August 2021,"The original ""Money Heist"" series was written and planned as a one-time thing, with the story arc of all characters' perfectly closed by the end of part two. The writers hardly held back with their choices, killed characters when the story needed it and you could feel the tension and danger as the events developed, because there was no need to keep people clean and alive for future seasons. With this second story arc, that forcefully brings the original gang together plus a couple of new additions, it's clear that the writers are trying to keep everything suspended for as long as possible. People always get this close to real danger, but almost nothing happens. The writers forgot that the characters are after all criminals if not terrorists, but they are now reincarnated as teenager idols with philosophic ideals against the dirty and corrupted authorities. All episodes are filled with soap opera nonsense, especially in a big portion of part 3. Part 4 gets slightly better even if the whole structure and dynamics are borrowed straight from the original season. They even found a way to have Arturo back as a hostage, which was like the most forced and stupid thing they could ever come up with. They know him well enough but still let him disrupt as usual. Palermo plays as the new unstable leader of the gang, and he even has yaoi side stories with multiple characters. Tokyo still holds the crown as the most stupid character ever, but I guess that she needs a bigger role because of her Instagram followers? No idea seriously. The first season was nothing deep nor groundbreaking, but the scale tipped towards the entertaining end of the show instead of the average teenager Netflix drama.",Money_heist

Ep. 1 was good but as each episode unfolds the story just gets more ridiculous, no siege in the history of mankind has gone on for so long for so little, the plot is held together by hysterical outbursts from characters.The female police inspector storms in and out of every scene not actually doing anything, at times I laughed out loud at her lines and reactions, in real life I think one of her co workers would have shot her, she creates more panic and threat than the bank robbers.Too silly, too long, too much over acting.",Money_heist
42,v-56289,I love hearing spanish...,7/10,26 January 2021,"In the first few episodes (those not from netflix) it actually looked like a commercial for Hilti tools..But than The money heist became a typical holywood style thrillers with spanish blood. It is full of cliches and ever repeating pattern -> every action of the gang works our, every attempt of the police fails, the perfect plan -> professor prepared for every situation, and also the cliche conspiracy -> the bankers are robbers, rich are bad, police is corrupt torturing the ""saint"" Rio (well isn't he one of those who sentenced many hostages to live with post-traumatic syndrom)...In later seasons (I saw first 3) it get to the edge of being ridiculous. Like Monica turned into a member of the gang called Stockholm heroically saves the rest of the gang (the whole shoot out scene was maybe over the edge already). Rachel, once keeps the professor in captivity, willing to kill him, suddenly she loves him, but than she gets suspended and wants revenge as nothing else in the world to finally rejoin him in Palawan and joining the gang to rob the bank of Spain... or Denver in one scene hating is father, in the other digging the tunnel furiously to save his life... very unstable characters...I am not sure if I will watch the 4th season. ""The war has started"" and the gradation may be too much for me already.. On the other side I have to admit that for the weak plot, laughable expressions of passion (hard to say what's hollywood, and what is spanish temperament), optically and acustically, the tv show is very well done (I mean the red suit, Dali masks and the soundtrack).

I love all the main characters and am throughly engaged in the story line itself. This isn't action series but more of drama, although it does have some moments where things do go down.My biggest complaint about this show has got to be the excessive amount of flashbacks. I HATE them sometimes I like throughly want to fast forward them but I don't. Most of the time they add virtually zero to actual storyline and they mess with the pacing alot. I would opt to remove them entirely and see strictly them in bank.I would def recommend this show to everyone into this style of story. I will advise it isn't for everyone as its slow burn and does take bit to get into things in the beginning but if you stick around you'll enjoy the ride.

44,mgd_m,Fatally flawed,4/10,22 July 2019,"It has some good and unexpected moments, but also lots of thin plot points. It's written in the usual millennial style: lengthen the thing again and again. And again.But the worst aspect is watching the characters having relationships and often taking the dumbest possible decisions. I would like to say they are totally unrealistic, but it's worse, it's like watching the Big Brother on tv: a bunch of crazy, narcissistic and brainless guys, fu**ing, fighting and switching sides all the time.Tokyo, Rio and Angel are extremely unlikeable, Nairobi and Denver almost are. Some of them are very badly acted. On the other hand, Berlin and Moscow are interesting and well acted characters. The Professor is just, well, the Professor.

45,elliotte2,Starts great....stop watching after Season 1...you will thank me,3/10,4 September 2021,"Season 1 was top notch
Season 2 kept the intense drama going but started dropping close to end
Season 3 We are trailing off, plot devices no longer making sense
Season 4 It became obvious that the writers was just writing the craziest stuff possible and throwing it on screen.Season 5 I stopped after episode 2 because it was all levels of stupidity. I did not care about ANY character and actors became 'cartoonish' where many people are playing over-the-top caricatures. Just sad....really really sad...

46,mcjensen-05924,Definitely Overrated But Enjoyable,7/10,29 July 2020,"I give 6.5 but rounded up. First off you need to get past the ridiculous plot that seeks to garner sympathy for criminals. Has the obligatory Netflix PC sub-plots and a few very annoying characters. But still very well produced and even enjoyable despite gaping holes in the story and absolutely unbelievable action sequences. Guns being pulled and pointed at each other constantly is definitely eye rolling material. Acting is above average and dialogue rings true. Some real depth of emotion in the characters emerge. Seasons 1& 2 are far superior to 3 & 4.

48,sunildaswaney-63642,Disappointing!,5/10,29 April 2020,"I found the first season to be very ordinary and not as sensational as it's being made out to be.I couldn't understand why ""Tokio"" provided the voiceover as she had the loudest and most obnoxious and sickening character and as a result it was very difficult to relate to her when she was relating the incidents in a calm manner.The ""Professor"" was not smooth at all and this was a big let down as he was supposed to be very knowledgeable which he was and Zen like which he was not. There were also some sub plots in the 1st season which did not make any sense at all.My favourite character was ""Berlin""
Even the 2and season was quite ordinary with the ""Professor "" making lots of silly mistakes which was very unbecoming of a professional and experienced strategist.
Once again in the 2nd season my favourite was "" Berlin""and to a lesser extent ""Moscow""
SEASON 3 IS A DISASTER and so not bothering to waste my time watching Season 4

51,nidhunmoviebuff,An era-defining global phenomenon!,9/10,8 December 2021,"Heist films, right from The Italian Job (1969) to Heat (1995) to the hugely successful Oceans series (2001-18) has been one of my favorite genres, with its intruiging protagonists, elaborate schemes and nail-biting suspense.But Money Heist remains the only series to capture the same attention on TV and retain the audiences for 5 long seasons. With their devil-may-care attitude and finely detailed character arcs, the series has become a global phenomenon, capturing the cultural zeitgeist of the digital era.The Professor is perhaps the most popular TV character on screen today, such is the fervent support Alvaro Morte's fully-involved, intricate depiction of the character generated. His scheming in the final season does not rise to the jaw-dropping levels of season 1 and 2, but leaves us with a satisfying climax to our favorite outlaw gang that has become a symbol for resistance against tyranny across the globe
Season 5 definitely ups the stakes with creator Alex Pena adding the Spanish military and more ruthless antagonists to ensure The Professor and gang have their backs to the wall throughout all the 10 episodes. If it was Enrique Arce as the detestable 'Arturo' that we all loved to hate in Volume 1, Volume 2 sees that mantle taken up by the irrepressible performance of Fernando Cayo as the ruthless 'Tamayo'.The non-linear narrative with drawn out flashback sequences may be a little tedious to watch in the initial episodes, but I promise you that those fine threads will get woven into a masterpiece by the final episode.While Volume 1 of Part 5 had us swooning over the poignant performance of the talented Ursula Corbero as the fan-favorite 'Tokyo', Volume 2 excels in its character building of Najwa Nimri, who nails the role of Alicia Sierra.I will badly miss The Professor, the loudmouthed but passionate Denver, the stubborn but dependable Helsinki, the fiercely loyal Lisbon and almost everyone from the Dali gang. I cannot wait for the spinoff series centred around Berlin!Highly, highly recommended! Bella Ciao La Casa de Papel! You will be missed!",Money_heist

The ""second"" season has much more action and rapid pacing, leading to a satisfying finale. Underlying theme is a little socialist, printing and stealing money out of thin air, compared towhat the Euro Reserve Bank does on a major scale.

56,arabnikita,I loved seasons 1 and 2...,7/10,8 April 2020,"Despite the visible decline in quality that was demonstrated in Season 3, I remained optimistic hoping that Season 4 will inject the much needed adrenaline and clever twists that will bring the show to a deserved finale. Let me put it this way, if the third season began to show small but noticeable cracks in the foundation, the fourth season decided to put a bomb inside one of the cracks and bring down the entire Casa.I think the objective of this season was to progress as little as possible because characters end up in the exact same situation as they were at the start. Every episode consists of 60% nonsensical romance or drama, 20% obligatory and pointless Berlin Flashback, 15% Police ""Planning"" and 5% of crazy action resulting in an admittedly good cliffhanger to make sure you stick around.While the elements of the plan are clever, they are often presented in such a ridiculous fashion that reduces their impact. The overall flow is inconsistent due to constant loss of focus in an attempt to stretch every minute. I used to love this show as it effectively balanced wits, drama and action creating a trully addictive experience. Now, it has become a soap opera that is a shell of it's former self.#moviesshmovies",Money_heist
57,Erik_Stone,Hard to stop watching,8/10,19 July 2020,"It's like Swiss cheese, with so many character foibles and plot holes, that one questions what you just swallowed.
You just swallowed a Spanish drama, eloquently dressed up as a thriller, mystery.
What's great is that it has pretty good English audio for people that can't tolerate the subtitles. It has the knack to make you want to get to the desperate end.It's a hodgepodge, montage of relationships, set in an attempt at a cohesive plot that ties lovers together in realistic and disturbing ways.I liked it. I think I should visit Spain.

There is nudity.Hollywood could not make anything like this, because Hollywood, nowadays, only has feeling and spice, behind the camera, not in front of it.This series is a mess of melodramatic, absurd caricatures, that interact with what could be the real world . . . the world of government control.
There is nothing realistic about it, except for the relationships that occur.It's a Latin soap opera, with a more fun backdrop, and with higher quality talent.The acting is superb. It does get slow, often, but it's about the moments, and the visual quality.The music editing could have been a lot better, but the that were picked, are fine.It's a wonderful fantasy, but nowhere near perfect.",Money_heist

If you look for the illogical and try to analyse the 'plan' one may as well skip this show. Example: The tunnel being build 5 years before, toward a federal building. Complete BS of course.

67,Paynebyname,Clever but ultimately childishly idiotic,3/10,29 May 2020,"I tuned into this hoping for a decent and clever bank heist tale. In some parts I got this.It feels like they first of all gave the script to some intelligent writers who conceived of these brilliant schemes to get into the bank, deal with the police and plan their escape. The kinds of antics that make the audience think 'wow, these guys are pretty smart'. The stakes are big, the planning is meticulous and the huge rewards worthy of the effort.When that was done, they then gave the script to a bunch of horny, adolescent teenagers who must have previously written 80's Australian soap operas. It is terrible. From establishing the actual job, it descends into a series of foolish characters who literally cannot keep their hands off each other and cannot keep their head in the game. They're shagging in vaults and toilets and offices. They're shagging when they are casing the joint, when they are doing the job and even with the lead investigator.From a job offering untold riches and the commitment of 5 weeks and the time for the heist, nobody can stay focused on what they are doing. They utter these silly speeches about how committed they are to the job and will kill anyone stopping it from happening but then in the next scene are willing to sacrifice it all for their sexual urges or the chance to be nice to hostages.So at the beginning, you are on the side of the criminals because their plan is so audacious but as it progresses you become more disinterested in their overly dramatic histrionics and complete lack of professionalism. There was one laughable scene where they were having another internal dispute and literally no one was supervising the hostages.Now, I'm sure people will say that you need to develop characters and yes you do but when those characters are acting so immaturely, so petulantly and so lacking in thought or consideration of the bigger picture, you just kinda get bored with them. You start looking for the most stupid and heist wrecking thing that they could do and laughing when they do it. I didn't tune in for a romantic drama but a bank heist and when the characters are behaving like silly teenagers, the tethers to your interest just withers away.You just want someone to shake these people and say 'we're talking about millions of Euro's each here. Is it possible you could remain on target for literally just the time of the heist (2/3 days) and then play out your love chasing routines when the job is done?' But even the guy at the very top is distracted by skirt so they all descend into silly unengaging children playing robbers.So overall, it was a fascinating concept that was ruined, and I do mean ruined, by characters acting so idiotically that they become laughable and unlikeable. They go from the no nonsense crew in Heat to a bunch of sexed up moronic clowns.",Money_heist

The plot sucks, you plan for months and you get this kiddy crap going on? Maybe I don't understand how stuff works in Europe, but a good show should make it seem somewhat real. There is nothing that feels real about the show. Gonna be in the building for days and yet they ""want"" a loose cannon on the team????

71,maanikroda,"Perfection, that's the name I reckon.",9/10,26 June 2020,"Salute to the actors and actresses. They really did a great job bringing the characters to life. And with the mix of the characters comprising the gang it is made even better. Though getting behind the idea of loving a heist is quite ironic but this show will just make anyone fall in love with it. In all honesty I did not expect as good as a blockbuster but the chemistry and the acting is just that good. A small drawback though is that the schemes were depicted as grand masterpieces with the gang of some great badass but in truth as the story unravels the drama is sandwiched by lots and intermittent petty fights which could baffle minds, questioning if they were realistic at each point of time during a heist, and if at all the assembly of the team was genuinely smart. I suppose a quick fix to that is to fast forward those scenes. But interestingly, the one character worth noting is Berlin. A man who's poetic though a criminal, a man who seems like he's lost his mind but sees through life and things and is more critically honest, unseemingly stable than his look and attitude may suggest. Then, on the extreme end of the personality spectrum, there's Tokyo the most unstable and volatile character of all time, the key piece who ruins the ingenious plans of the heist almost without fail, which optimists would say is crucial to bringing balance to the development of this drama. I personally would give it a 10 if not for the unrealistic personalities.",Money_heist

73,MovieJunkie5,La casa de Papel,8/10,5 April 2020,"La Casa de Papel is a unique tv show. It had a very good first season, the plot was original, the actors were incredible, it was action-packed and high-tension. Now with the fourth season, it's still good but not quite the same. A lot of plotholes that don't add up and 2 seasons left in a cliffhanger just to make you wait for yet another season to probably end up like that again. It's good, don't interpret me wrong, but it doesn't have the same quality as before.

74,rdvljunk,what's the fuzz about?,4/10,15 August 2019,"I gave up after 4-5episodes, it became really silly although I see the potential. But mainly the storylines of the people outside the bank are ridiculous. There is a big big robbery with hostages going on and the chief negotiator goes out every now and then to get a sandwich in a nearby bar? Where she meets the brain of the robbery? And can't leave her daughter with her ex because he's claimed to be violent, but can leave her with her dementing mother?...and when the ex takes the child (and brings it back after a few hours), again she leaves the scene of the robbery to solve a domestic issue?

The most watched show in Europe, Spain's biggest ever viewing figures etc. Then from a promising start the program just gets more and more ridiculous. Now I know it's just apiece of entertaining fictional drama but half the skill in making a show like this is to get the audience to think as far fetched as the plot is a part of you would like to think it could be done.The show makes the perpetrators and the police look as stupid and as dumb as each other. You get robbers falling in love and having sex, robbers having sex with hostages and wait for it the mastermind behind the robbery having sex with the chief inspector in charge of the police operation. The plot has more holes than a second hand dart board. Only the production value and some good set pierces save this from one star. 3/10",Money_heist

Also, Im excited for part 4 because everything about series may proof that part 4 is coming. Great characters, great story, great atmosphere... It is worth to see it.

The characters are superb, the story is intense and overall drama and action keeps you hooked on this until you need to go to sleep... All of this with a touch of Spanish spirit... A few shows come to my mind which would be as bold innovative and work on your mind like a dose of cocaine... This one is something like a mix of Experiment 2, Lost, Prison Break and Death Note...
You have that main mastermind Yagami Light style guy which constantly plays a game against a police detective... You have a bunch of characters which ended up in a situation where they need to learn to work with each other Lost style... And you have all of the Drama of Experiment2 and Action of the Prison Break... Bravo my Spanish friends, the world indeed will talk and remember you as heroes ...

78,mmuggi,Season 1,5/10,14 January 2021,"The first season of La Casa De Papel is a caricatured affair. In addition to its fine intro, and special breathtaking scenography, it is a series with a really thick and clich√©d dialogue. The robbers have a desire to have the public with them, which seems stupid and naive, because after all, they are just a bunch of glorified robbers. The season is running in loop, with the abundance of sex and the fact that El Proffesor is constantly two steps ahead. The police are equated with puppets and incompetent, but at the end of the season, it is actually the police who are most in control. The action scenes are very dramatic, and with great caricature. The Special forces weapons sounds like the weapon on a combat helicopter.However, it is a pulsating and lively series that dances to its own rhythm, and it must also have credit for that. We have to see what season 2 brings.

79,manuel_medeiros,"Had they made only 2 seasons, Casa de Papel would be a solid 10",9/10,7 April 2020,"I truly believe Casa de Papel is one of the most gripping series ever made for television. I breezed through series 4 in 3 days, even though there's a downgrade in quality versus previous seasons.Why is it so good?There's action at every turn. The stakes are constantly raised for those robbers and therefore so is the viewer's attention. It keeps you glued to your screen throughout.Not only that, is does so while creating 1) compelling characters (who you root for) and 2) the narrative that this convoluted heist is much more than that. There's a reason why the Salvador Dali masks have broken from the screen and into our generation's culture - the characters seem to be part of a bigger feeling of anti-establishment, revolt. And as an audience, that definitely makes you more engaged.The closest thing I can find perhaps to the first 2 series of Casa de Papel, is the first season of Prison Break. Never a dull moment, incredibly involving characters and full of heartfelt moments and suspense at the same time.The only downside of Casa de Papel is a natural one - it felt a victim of its own, unprecedented success. It's no accident it is the most successful non-English language show on Netflix.But as the creators tried to stretch the narrative for more seasons, it became less compelling. A new heist felt less believable, the human bonds between the robbers felt too forced and more corners were taken in terms of storytelling to advance the story.Series 3/4 are not as bad as some reviewers claim here, but indeed you should expect some decay in the show's grip.That being said - this is still very much worth a watch. Especially you are after a compelling, binge-worthy show. You needn't look further. The first 2 series will not disappoint you for sure. It is the perfect show to introduce English speaking audiences to quality television done beyond that realm.PS: the score throughout the show is on point. It brought back Bella Ciao into people's imaginary, but many episodes absolutely nail the chosen soundtrack. Another aspect worth praising the creators for.",Money_heist

83,Benslie,An emotional rollercoaster ride that I was not expecting,9/10,30 December 2021,"The biggest reason why I highly suggest watching this series is for the outstanding acting performances in this series. I watched this show in the original language Spanish and it just made everything better. The entire cast brought their everything to this show. There were specifically two actors in this show that just stole the show for me and those two are √Ålvaro Morte, who plays Sergio Marquina, and Itziar Itu√±o, who plays Raquel Murillo aka Lisbon. √Ålvaro Morte had a hard job to do with having to switch between being The Profesor and Salva/Sergio but nailed it. You can see how much time and effort he put into creating these two different characters and being able to show the difference between the two. This is best shown in the scene from Part/Season 2 when Raquel figures out who he really is and you slowly see him switch from being Salva to The Profesor. In just a few seconds he slowly changes from being extremely happy to stone-faced which isn't an easy task but he did it so smoothly that it helps the audience figure out when he's in Profesor mode and not. Itziar Itu√±o might not have had as hard of a task to do but what impressed me the most with her was all of the emotions she brought to her character. There are two scenes that come to mind for me that help show this which are when she tells Salva about her past relationship with her abusive ex in Part/Season 1 and when she realizes that Salva is The Profesor in Part/Season 2. Both of scenes are super emotional scenes and her performance captivated the audience and see her as this tough female character.I also wanted to quickly shout out √örsula Corber√≥, who plays Tokio, and Alba Flores, who plays Nairobi, both of them also brought so much emotion that once it came time to see them go the audience is left in tears. But like I said every single actor did an incredible job in this show and helped make the audience feel like a member of this gang/family or hate their character. What also helped the audience feel like they were a part of this gang was the writing for this show. The writing in this show made it feel like you weren't watching these people reading lines but were people just robbing a bank and having fun. Another thing that just really intrigues me about the show and the writing in specifically the story. When I first started watching this show, I just thought this was another show about a group of individuals just trying to rob a bank but I was very wrong. The story for this show is so much more intriguing and emotional. What helps make this show stand out and be a breath of fresh air is the commentary in this show. Obviously, there's the commentary on the government and all that but this show does tackle other issues. I mentioned this earlier but they deal with abuse with a significant other and how the woman if never seen as the victim. Multiple times Raquel is told how she already ruined her ex-husbands career as a police officer with her false allegations and that she should take them back. This also leads into commentary of women in the police force and how no matter what will never be viewed as equals. When the police learn who The Profesor is and discover that Raquel has been dating him they all immediately turn on her and label her as a mole and traitor. The biggest issue that they bring up with the second heist is how police officers think they are the law. Multiple times Coronel Tamayo, played by Fernando Cayo, says he is the law and goes against the law. These are just some of the bigger issues the show touches on but it does deal with more and I do wish for some of them they went deeper. It's these real-life issues that bring help bring the audience in on this emotional rollercoaster ride.This show has so much emotion to it that it's hard not to cry while watching. This show is going to take you on an emotional rollercoaster and you better be prepared because one second you're going to be having fun with the crew then crying about losing a teammate to wanting to punch a character to watching people fall in love. Once again all of these emotions would not be possible without the actors giving it their everything for these characters. These characters don't feel like characters you're watching on screen but actual people. All of the characters were unique and fully fleshed out which made it easy to connect and care for these people. It especially helps when you see scenes like the Bella Ciao scene in both Part/Season 1 and 5, the soccer scene in Part/Season 4 and the Hake scene in Part/Season 5. All of those scenes showed the gang being more than just a gang but a family. The family dynamic even goes into their personal relationships since the gang is really good at breaking the first rule. This show has some of the best relationships both platonic and romantic. Both pairs of family members in this group felt like real-life family members with the way they spoke and acted with each other. That's why when both Denver, played by Jaime Lorente, and Sergio lose their family member you feel that pain as well. Especially in the case with Berlin's, played by Pedro Alonso, death who I hated with a passion but when he died and saw how it affected Sergio I started to tear up as well. Every single romantic relationship in this show was also well-done with my personal favorite being Sergio and Raquels relationship because their relationship has the best evolution out of the three main relationships. One thing that felt like a character in of itself in this show were the set designs and specifically the sets for the Mint and Royal Bank. The set design team did an incredible job creating those sets and making the audience feel like a hostage with barely showing the full thing and in doing so making the audience feel trapped in this massive place as well. The sets were so good that I wanted to crawl through the vents myself and felt so bad when they had to destroy the Bank of Spain set at the end of Part/Season 5.Most shows use flashbacks to show the past of a character but this show used flashbacks in a more creative way that I honestly enjoyed. Instead of having the entire first part/season be about them making the plan and showing them talking about all of the backup plans they instead decided to only show them when it would connect into the main storyline. For example, with Plan Alcatraz where the audience believes that the Profesor and Lisbon are in trouble and most likely will get caught but a flashback shows that they already thought this through and had a plan ready. This is really good use of flashbacks as it still makes the audience think the characters are in trouble when in reality, they already thought it out. I was totally prepared to shred the flashback of Berlin and his son but in the end, it also connected into the main story and I applaud them for that. One thing that did bug me was the use of time cards. For the first heist in part/seasons 1 and 2 the show used time cards in order to show how much time has passed since the start of the heist but for the second heist they never did. I'm conflicted with this as without the time cards you feel more like a hostage with not knowing how much time has passed and what day it is but at the same time it's hard to follow especially when the first one did use them. The musical score for this series is incredible and helps convey so much emotion for this series. The last thing I want to mention is the cinematography in this show. I love how they used a yellow tint or a darker color to represent whenever they were in a flashback and then just had regular lighting for present day scenes. I also liked how you can tell that they used natural lighting for this entire series. In the end, La Casa De Papel aka Money Heist isn't just a show about a heist but is an emotional rollercoaster that is worth checking out. I give La Casa De Papel a 9/10.",Money_heist
84,lallo-2,"Well, many mistakes, sometime very slow",6/10,13 December 2018,"The idea is fantastic. Some actors are very good. Some parts of the episodes are so awesome.There are many tech errors. The history has several holes.In one episode there is a very sad song ""Bella Ciao"" an Italian song related to the invasion of the Nazis troops in the ww2. It's used in a very joyful moment but the real meaning is externe desperation. For this I removed 1 point to the global score. It's a severe error.

85,Waedliman,Too long,6/10,18 April 2021,"I admit, I had a point in season 2 where I wanted to quit. Those eternal flashbacks were getting on my nerves, the mixture of telenovela and thriller, plus this constant bombardment of fast spoken Spanish, my nerves were a bit tense, to be honest. But I kept at it, because I enjoyed some good actors and of course I wanted to know how it would end. The fact that it doesn't end after season 4 amazed me, because there really should have been a point here. So now the fifth is coming and I fear the worst. Two stories that are actually one don't need 40+ episodes. This could easily have been packed into two seasons and condensed, with less incidental stuff and more focus on the characters. I hope that some of the characters who really get on my nerves will bite the dust. So of course I will watch season 5 ;-)

90,nagsaptarshi,Bella Ciao- Welcome to the Festival,8/10,16 September 2021,"When Money Heist was first aired in Spain, it did not have too many admirers. Made on a shoestring budget, the show had a very average outing and the makers had to withdraw the show after the first season. From there its journey till date has been phenomenal, owing to the outrageous popularity of the characters of the show. Ever since the day Netflix undertook the uphill task of carrying the show forward, Money Heist has been gaining cult status. With every passing series, the fan following has seen a meteoric rise in popularity.Reviewing total forty-one episodes spread across four and half seasons is not an easy job. Money Heist today is not just a mere web series. It is a celebration. It is a festival. It is an extravaganza. It is a cult you want to be part of. It is a guilt you want to nurture within you.First thing first. Money Heist is in no way a perfect work. It is indeed full of goof-ups. It has countless loose ends. In fact, there is a problem with the continuity of the series. The storyline was never made at one go. The script was developed while the shooting was going on. This has jeopardized the pace of the story on numerous occasions. Certain scenes have been so poorly inserted in the main story that you tend to get deviated from the baseline. There is a problem with editing, too. On many occasions, the episodes have been deliberately protracted without adding any new dimension to the main story.The ideals promoted on the show live on thin grounds. The communist innuendos are inconclusive, vague, and suffer from a lack of subtlety. There are numerous references to the anti-capitalist nature of the heist, but none of the actions of the protagonists justifies such belief. The exorbitant use of red was one way to show its lenience. But the actions did not go well hand in hand with the color-coding.The outdoor scenes bring the necessary relief from claustrophobic, stifling sets of the heists. Camera works inside the banks have drawn inspiration from the likes of the Godfather or Scarface. The use of color in the entire show has been meager and therefore unappealing at times.Character portrayal is another area where the series suffers miserably. Important characters like Palermo, Arturo, Suarez, Angel, Stockholm are very poorly drawn and they deviate from the Arctic to Antarctica in seconds. At times, the character development is so thin that it borderlines annoyance.The Spanish forces have been portrayed as clowns throughout the series. The imbecility of the police, army, national intelligence will make you laugh at times. In so many scenes, science was the last thing the makers had on their minds. The tents built for investigation look ludicrous and so are the protestors outside the bank.With so many flaws, any other show would not have lasted more than two seasons. But Money Heist after four and a half seasons is still ruling over the hearts of the audiences across the globe. Even though I am a staunch critic of the technicalities of the show, I cannot wait for December to come when the show is expected to have a Grand Finale. Actually, in certain areas, Money Heist scores so many points that it succeeds in overshadowing the weaknesses. Let us discuss the brighter aspects.Alvaro Morte as the Professor and the mastermind behind the heists is brilliant. He is suave, restrained, and exuberates the right dose of emotional punches the series needed. His mannerisms are magnetic, his personality charming and his emotions are raw. You cannot but love this man, so powerful are his appeals. Itziar Ituno as Raquel Murillo is likeable. Her smiles stay with you once the end credits of each episode start rolling. The chemistry between Professor and Raquel aka Lisbon is one of the cardinal binding forces of Money Heist. Ursula Corbero as Tokyo is fascinating and she is the powerhouse of the abundant energy the show boasts of. Pedro Alonso as Berlin, Najwa Nimri as Alicia, Alba Flores as Nairobi, Jaime Lorente as Denver all have something or the other to love or hate their respective characters. It is their relationships that keep the show afloat.Death is periodic and planned throughout the series. Each series sees one of the protagonists bidding adieu. This maintains the necessary momentum of the show. In fact, some of the death scenes are so beautifully planned that it becomes difficult to keep the eyes dry. It is the feeling of letting go that helps Money Heist score maximum points. The emotional quotient is so high that it supersedes the technical glitches of this iconic web series and it is the cardinal reason of its gigantic success. The interpersonal relationships of the principal characters are so delicately dealt with that you condone the makers for the faults they made elsewhere. This celebration of relationship touches the right point of the hearts of its viewers so much so that you forget the difference between good and bad, right and wrong, just and unjust and you start rooting for the robbers. Money Heist is a celebration of love, friendship, brotherhood. And this celebration is what gives it the iconic status. The show is laden with brilliant music and amazing background scores and the melodies stay with you long after you have completed all the episodes.Overall, Money Heist has something for everybody and even though it lacks brain, its sensuality intermingled with adrenaline rush is going to captivate you.Bella Ciao...7.5 out of 10.",Money_heist
91,nagsaptarshi,Money Heist- joie de vivre,8/10,4 December 2021,"Series 5 part 2 review- As we bid adieu to the Professor and his charismatic gang, I have no qualms in admitting that this was the best possible ending one could have hoped for. The part 2 of the ending season is even more stylish than the previous installments and after of all the seasons, this is arguably the most convincing one. The backup plan of the backup plan is possibly the trick that wins your heart. I am not going to reveal much as that would be a spoiler then, but I must admit at times I started feeling it was over and there was no further way of escaping for the gang. But the mastermind Professor had already planned how he was going to react once everything has failed. And that was the masterstroke. The English version has some brilliant dialogues. Raquel Murillo as always was breathtakingly beautiful. The Professor needless to say was at his suave and classy best. The role of Alicia was the biggest surprise of the show. Thankfully, in this part no one had to die and at the end it was a happy ending. As I have already discussed the pros and cons of the series at length, I am not going to reiterate those here. But take my word, the Grand Finale of the most loved web series ever will not disappoint you.Whole Series Review

92,lakings97,Great series!,8/10,27 December 2021,"Money Heist: Part 5 on Netflix is the final season of an amazing series. Part 5 continues with the gang being caught up in the middle of standoff trying to buy time to melt all the gold in the bank reserve. Most of the characters return to an otherwise predictable finale with a few twists along the way. While I was watching the finale I noticed a similarity to another great movie, Die Hard. The only difference is that John McClane doesn't exist in this series. I noticed it when Palermo was sitting across from the Marine Commander and he tells Palermo that they are terrorists trying to rob the country. Hans Gruber was questioned the same manner by Mr. Nakamoni himself not realizing they were there to steal all the bonds from the vault. Although the audience watching Die Hard was not rooting for Hans, the fans of Money Heist couldn't wait to see how the team was going to escape from the clutches of Tamayo. Another thing that bothered me was what did the Professor write to his nephew to release the possession of the gold. Overall great series but I expected something more from the ending, something powerful not a slow sequence walk off into the sunset. Definitely a must see series, one day to rewatch with my son.",Money_heist
93,kyragd2009,Average,1/10,4 May 2020,"Plot is similar to ""Prison Break"" but very bad version of it! I couldn't wait the next episodes of ""Prison Break""! This one? ""ehhh""",Money_heist
94,ricochet93-369-308802,Good if you are 13 years old,4/10,29 August 2021,"I really and truely do not get the brilliant reviews. You really have to suspend all logic, it may as well be sci-fi.They lock themselves away for months planning this heist...and within the first hour they have manage to let a teenage girl get access to a phone and leave people unsupervised to run around the bank. Then going soft for captives.Just ridiculous.",Money_heist
95,ClapperProject,It could've been one of the all time greatest,8/10,8 December 2021,"I accompanied the show since it became a global phenomenon, and the first two seasons, place the bar for heist movies / TV shows on a whole other level.The customs, the characters, the set, the cinematography every thing was brilliantly made, the concept itself has been portrayed many times throughout the years but this was one of the most creative approaches I've seen.Of course all of this was only possible because of the engaging and amazingly portrayed ""Professor"" character, this highly intelligent individual that due to his past among other reasons, is the master mind behind the assault to the Royal Mint of Spain where the country prints its moneyThe planning and methodology of the assault is amazing, and throughout the first seasons you can even see some elements of tension and realism very present on shows like Breaking Bad - everything was thought out by the Professor, and the unreliable narrator type of narrative allows for many twists to happen.The anti-establishment message and the way all of the grey areas are depicted, made it become an instant success once Netflix started to stream it but for me personally that was also why the show started to lose quality.The first two seasons are incredible and should stand on their own, its clear that the show should have ended exactly there, it would have been perfect and an obvious 10/10, but of course greed always speaks louder.The third season is not awful, you can still find yourself engaged however things quickly turn bad on season 4....
The realism went out the window, with pathetic gunshot fighting scenes straight from bad Hollywood action movies, poor dialogue, soap opera relationships and there is even a Rambo type character which takes out all of the show essence.Sure, the show doesn't end bad, it has a decent finale, however the impact and connection you made with it on the first seasons fades completely once you see the 4th - it started amazing and it ended fine but somewhere along the line it lost its own identity, and it's sad in the sense that it could've been remembered for being one of the best TV shows made.",Money_heist
96,pub-21,Okay but not good,5/10,6 December 2019,"Watching in original language could be important as the English dubbing is atrocious. After 4 or 5 episodes I turned on subtitles and there are a lot of different dialogue which leads me to believe the subtitle translation is more true to original language version. The dubbing would appear to have been Americanised and makes the very often implausible plot more stupid.
Other than so many implausible scenes, it can be a bit slow and boring for a crime/action show.
Over all if you can't watch in native tongue there are better shows to waste a few days on.

97,dogonlion,Lame writing,2/10,8 August 2020,"I think people got excited to see a foreign show in Spanish that looks good and it does look good on screen. That said, the story is full of holes and very little makes sense. The difference between a well written script like Breaking Bad and a poorly written one like this one is with the good one you forget you're watching TV. With Money Heist it's not possible. Criminals don't discuss the well being of their hostages with them and wether they should get an abortion or not. WHAT? If a hostage was able to get a cell phone after cell phones were confiscated, the first thing any hostage with half a brain would do is to put it on silent. There's even a part where a body is supposed to be dead but you can see the breathing by looking at his stomach. Hollywood has resolved these kinds of challenges a long time ago. I think they meant to create a story about a guided tour where people are stuck on the inside and start to develop bonds. Then what they discuss with each other would make sense. I'm stopping this on the third episode. I've watched too many great shows and yet to see more that I cannot settle for this. I gave it 2 stars for the picture quality.",Money_heist

99,veinctor,I quit during episode 3,3/10,14 May 2021,"I almost never complain about acting and the casting but oh boy, the american dub is atrocious and the actors feel like they have mostly been miscast.Most times I dont even complain about the direction, but even in the very first episode this show is all over the place. It's not that the main time line jumps to flashbacks, I can live with that. But when the heist starts and it cuts over and over to some random woman who got impregnated by her married boss... something feels terribly off.I do however usually complain about the story and the people's actions. And oh boy this is bad! They are planning this heist for years and they don't expect to get shot at? They make the hostages dig a hole and they leave them on their own? They have orders not to kill people and they decide to kill people? They are told not to tell their names to each other and one of them gives a dog tag with his name to a woman that brings it to the heist? Two bad guys have to look after a girl but they fight each other and the girl activates the internet? The leader is calm and doesnt emanate fear to anyone.Even the drama is bad and rushed! A school girl (a politicians daughter) receives a text from a classmate in the middle of a school trip and they kiss within 10 seconds and they attempt to have sex in the next 10 minutes when she appears to be shy and apparently they have never talked to each other? Come on!This movie wants to feel grand but fails in every level. Everyone feels like an idiot, especially when they are overconfident and laugh uncontrollably without a real reason. Most men are bubbling morons. And from what I read the show doesnt get any better.",Money_heist

It's one thing if things go wrong, and you expect that, otherwise there's no conflict and no interest in a story. But when it's characters doing dumb things, it gets annoying fast.
Anyway, it's a decent show but the characters will piss you off pretty quick.

105,theoledoux,A light seven for an overrated and unrealistic series,7/10,23 September 2020,"Casa De Papel is a clearly overhyped and overrated series. That doesn't mean it doesn't shine in certain parts, but it does mean that it falls short of delivering on the expectations set by its massive fanbase. It's laughably unrealistic at times, more often than not. The problem is everything is set up for you to picture this happening in real life. I couldn't shake off the feeling that this series could've been something truly amazing. Instead, we get a sort of soap opera that is afraid of taking real risks and frequently uses cheap tricks to insert ridiculous plot twists into its narrative. This series loves to kill off their most interesting characters, and it will continue to do so, until it truly becomes unwatchable (hopefully they stop making it worse by making another 2 seasons). I truly lost respect for this show after they blatantly copied Interstellar's and Mad Max Fury Road's music. It is so obvious that it disgusts me. How can no one mention this? It's like the makers of CDP felt like plagiarism can't affect them...

106,r-fronimides,"Good action & drama, SUPER NAIVE & SILLY scenarios!",6/10,2 December 2021,"I really don't know WHY this show is so popular and so high rated. Truly, makes no sense......The plot in ANY season is ridiculous. A group of AMATEUR or SMALL EXPERIENCE thieves, are involved in IMPOSSIBLE roberies. Okay, ""El Profesor"" is the genious guy, the clever man, he designs incredible plans to succeed. But, even so, even if you do have incredible plan, the task is not less IMPOSSIBLE - those kind of roberies.Okay... ""I'm buy it""... in the 1st & 2nd seasons, lets say this robery COULD BE DONE (in real life it would be impossible too, but lets say is the MOST ""MAYBE"" scenario), altough if in the 2nd season we have IMPOSSIBLE resques and other things.But okay... ""I'm buy it"".And then... when the show SHOULD BE ENDED... because it has fans and making money... they ""found"" a SUPER-RIDICOLOUS & NAIVE story to continue it.The gang, ALL MILLIONERS, having our dreams' lives... and then RIO it makes a STUPID thing and getting arrested. Because of that... TOKIO's ""forcing"" their leader (""El Profesor"") to make a plan to resque him...
...and ""El Profesor"" launching A 1000% TIMES MUCH MORE IMPOSSIBLE ROBERY PLAN than the first original one! All that... just to resque RIO.And when they finaly done this, they keep staying in the bank with HALF SPANISH ARMY & THE ENTIRE POLICE all around them, surrounding them!No killing... no hostages' executioning... no killing the rioting prisoners... nothing (just before the 2 last episodes of the 5th season)!These are the MOST GOOD ""BOY-SCOUT"" robers in the entire history... armed like ""Rambo""... but NOBODY's killing anyone!Seriously, fellas... the SCENARIOS of those seasons (even the first two) are like they've been written by 9 years old kids!SUPER SILLY scenarios!I like the REALISTIC stories.I like stories, films, movies that they have REALISTIC scenarios and making wonder ""hey, could that be true, based on actual events?""So, ""Casa de Papel"" is a SUPER ""FICTION"" REALLY NAIVE story. Yes, full of action, drama, emotions, but... NOT A BIT realistic.",Money_heist
107,Her-Excellency,Ridiculously Overrated,6/10,7 February 2021,"With some engaging characters and a money heist script with several twists, this started off SO WELL!!!Unfortunately, however, it would seem that sometime during the first season someone realized they had an audience they wanted to keep around for a while, and from that moment on, it went downhill, quickly. Like a marmalade that will only go so far, they began to water-down the story in order to spread it out for as long as they could make it last, ultimately making it almost unappetizable.What seemingly would have been a masterpiece if allowed to run in its predetermined time, pace and format, became a stretched-out mess and with so much stretching, something had to give. As in a bad, pieced-together tapestry, this developed so many glaring plot holes that even those who are best blessed at being able to suspend belief in order to enjoy a tv series or film, will eventually find it tedious and disheartening that one needs to do it so DAMN MUCH to keep this story on the rails. Not only are there innumerous plot holes, but the telling of the story grows more and more formulaic by the episode, and is way too often preposterously predictable.The acting is give or take, and while some of the cast excels, others do not. Worse, still, the characters much like the original title (La Casa De Papel), lack real substance and are merely paper, molded as the scene requires, rather than being given lives and backgrounds and breath and purpose of their own, even though they spout about ""purpose"" almost ad-nauseum.Then there is the fascination which the creators seem to have with either the actress who plays Tokyo (√örsula Corber√≥), or with the character itself or with what Natalie Portman's character in Leon the Professional would have grown up to be like (in their minds). In an effort to make an appealing character, which both men wanted and women could relate to, they bent her into a parody of a damaged superhero with psycho tendencies; an over-the-top, non-sexy, raging-hot, flip-the-switch temper; mommy-issues; street-bike stunt capabilities; good or bad, fighting abilities (depending on the scene); and oh, yes, a heart of gold or titanium or slush, which needs tending to and healing, also depending on the scene. In short, in wanting to create an amazing, powerful lead character, they morphed her into Frankenstein with sultry eyes. She reminds me of the quote from Pride and Prejudice: "" I never saw such a woman. Surely she would be a fearsome thing to behold."" A miss in my book. Raquel too, (played by Itziar Itu√±o), was denied the opportunity to be at least a somewhat balanced character, but unlike Tokyo's character which is purposefully built up, Raquel's character is a plot device which is torn down repeatedly and made to look ridiculous in many situations in order to further the script. The other characters in the first two seasons, Berlin especially and also The Professor, are written well (with the exception of THAT plot device in seasons 3 and 4 which I will not go into here). The rest of the main cast is pretty likeable on an interchangeable scale. I would be remiss not to also mention Jos√© Manuel Poga who plays C√©sar Gand√≠a and Najwa Nimri who plays Inspector Alicia Sierra in Seasons 3 and 4. They are two of the toughest 'tough guys' I've seen in a series and do great in their respective roles.Both despite and because of this, Money Heist (terrible change of title, by the way) engages you - ESPECIALLY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SERIES, because it is a whole, undiluted, rich story at the beginning - with fluid, deep moments of brilliance, that unfortunately, come around less-and-less often, until we barely see them at all.If you are intent on watching it, listen to the bad reviews and go in with very little and low expectations - perhaps you will then, like those who first discovered it, be surprised and will enjoy it. If you go in expecting much, you WILL be disappointed. It rolls over, like a gigantic wet blob, over its' own hype.",Money_heist
108,xpics,Absolutely gripping and entertaining despite its flaws and conveniences!,7/10,1 May 2020,"Unlike most fans of 'Money Heist' who have watched the show over seasons, I watched all four seasons in a go over the past month. So my anticipation or wait for the upcoming seasons were not as high as others, since I was sure that I shall be watching the next season soon after. So I did not get the time to build up my expectations so high as many other viewers might have over the season breaks. That gives me a, more or less, objective view on the show.Season 1 and 2 are path-breaking for it set a world we had not seen before in Heist films. Absolutely amazing! So I would directly go to speak about season 3 and 4. Undoubtedly after the brilliance shown in the first 2 seasons, expectations were rife with the new season and what the new Heist had in store. What was, possibly, somewhat underwhelming for many was that the modus operandi of the Heist was more or less similar to the earlier Heist with taking control of an important government building, holding hostages and negotiating with the system. In fact even the production design of Bank of Spain looked pretty much similar to the Royal Mint. The escape from the building is still to happen at the end of season 4, so it would be interesting to know how the team gets out this time and hopefully it should be something more imaginative than the digging underground tunnel route taken earlier.Another aspect that viewers might have found a little not at par with earlier seasons is the professor's charisma. In the first two seasons, The Professor, for me, has been almost equivalent to God who calculated in advance how could things go wrong at various junctures in a Heist and had a backup plan for almost everything. In season 3 and 4, while The Professor plans to evaluate the Heist to the same level of finesse, his plans malfunction or backfire at several instances, thereby diluting the Demigod status given to him in earlier seasons. Certainly his character has a natural progression from the earlier season and, unlike how he was emotionally disconnected with his team members earlier, this time he carries a strong emotional baggage with his girlfriend also being in the team and his increasing proximity with almost all gang members, which makes him vulnerable.Money Heist has a lot of technical flaws, loopholes or plot conveniences. But the pacing is so fast and the writing is too tight and full of unexpected twists and turns that despite its flaws, the viewer is still hooked on to the show. Not only does it have strong hook points at end of each episode, the narrative is gripping through the entire course of every episode. The several subplots add interesting layers to the show and the characters are robustly built over the seasons. It is amazing how they brought back one of my favourite characters - Berlin in Season 3 and 4 as well. His integration into the plot and contribution to the heist is very smartly done.I do miss the Professor's double chemistry with Raquel as being the mastermind of the heist as well as her love-interest, which for me was one of the major highlights of the first 2 seasons. Of the new characters, Alicia as the new negotiating cop is pure evil. And the mad assasin one-man-army Gandia as a bullet gone lose inside the Bank is a character you hate and that is perhaps his victory. Also, the makers very efficiently make us root for a group of all grey characters who are all on the wrong side of the law but you still want them to win. Of the older lot, I personally am bored of Tokyo who has become kind of boring with her character as well as performance.There are theories that Professor might die in the next season but Money Heist as a show will survive only as long as Professor survives. Till then keep us entertained with the same energy!",Money_heist
109,dkgupta493,Good hiest series,10/10,26 June 2021,"Money Heist is a very good show it is having a very good actor like falling if he is the more I like him the next one is the professor professor and his girlfriend Marino that is also very beautiful the other character that is to Q that is also very beautiful and I like this series it is full of suspense and thriller and action so everyone can enjoy without boring.

110,chris-j-chuba,Breaking Bad meets Ocean's 11,10/10,20 September 2021,"Later on why it's so divisive.The action maintains tension without a high body count. Movies like John Wick are tedious because the killing is so repetitive. Here, 'the Professor' outwits the police by showing them that pressing an attack is a really bad idea. The police Capt bites lip and then calls it off. This keeps the body count low and the audience engaged with, 'how is he going to get out of this next mess'. This alone makes the show worth watching more than the standard Netflix offerings.I agree that 'S3', which moves onto their next big caper, drags a bit but it still retains its edge. The flashbacks are overused and feel like packing material, great, yet another scene of them sitting at a table, laughing, drinking and exchanging quips. I started skipping over them and was able to follow the plot just fine. Occasionally, I would rewind if I felt I had missed some context.Why the hate, the 1/10?I suspect that many resent that the writers portray the authorities as evil and them making an analogy to the U. S. But I'm fine with how they do it.The local police are generally good. It's the feds who take over who are evil. More specifically the Spanish equivalent of Homeland Security, NIS, CIA, etc, and I get the impression the writers take this subject seriously. The feds have the power to bend the rules and have gotten used to doing it. Does Spain really have the resources depicted in this show, or is this a dig at the U. S?In the U. S. we love our military. 'Seal Team' is a popular show. Our guys fall on hand grenades to save bunnies. Showing elite security forces as anything other than heroic doesn't sit well for us. But It's catnip for me as I'm in the power corrupts camp.",Money_heist

115,rich7354,Does not live up to the billing,5/10,12 November 2020,"The first two episodes of this series were simply amazing. It was clever and witty as the Professor and Inspector played their game of cat and mouse. Unfortunately, due to the faulty premise that they could build an entire season on a single event (the heist), the series was doomed from the start.After the first two episodes the pace became quite slow and boring as they were forced to throw in a lot filler in order to pad out the season. Adding on soapy romantic melodrama only brought the series down further.I have not finished season one yet (I'm on episode 12), and I'm not sure if I will.

116,JaikrishnaVS,A classic thriller with more oomph than dud moments.,8/10,27 April 2018,"Money Heist came in as a highly recommended series , by many of my friends and it did not disappoint. Its an 'almost masterpiece' which at times failed to keep up with the dizzying plot build up that it had over the first few episodes. It's about a group of robbers spearheaded by the meticulous mastermind 'El Profesor' (√Ålvaro Morte) who plans to rob the 'The Royal Mint' by printing 2.4 billion Euros and thereby accomplishing the biggest heist ever !
Like most of the heist stories of our times, the group is carefully assembled together from scratch by the brain of the whole operation and here its the Professor. He teaches and prepares the team of robbers for 6 months so that they can pull off the perfect heist and go by their chosen city names. Thus, the calm and composed Berl√≠n (Pedro Alonso), hothead and narrator/heroine Tokio (√örsula Corber√≥) , genius counterfeiter Nairobi ( Alba Flores), computer whizkid R√≠o (Miguel Herr√°n) , the father son duo of Denver and Moscow and the muscles of the twin brothers come together to take hostages and lock out the Royal Mint as they go about their business of printing Money. On the other side of the fence is the brilliant Raquel Murillo ( Itziar Itu√±o) who heads the investigation against the Professors team.
Money Heist has its fair share of ups and downs throughout and some of the plot twists could not have been timed any better. Even with all that what got to my nerve is the fact that is the character of Tokio, from whose point of view the whole heist is explained. Every single time something goes south in the plan we know whom to point to fingers at and this was probably a masterstroke by the creator √Ålex Pina. It always add to the intrigue when you dislike the main character and yet love the plot. 
I ended up binge watching both the seasons of 'Money Heist ' and loved it for most parts. If you are into thriller genre and can ignore a few unwanted (read - boring) scenes you would end up loving the series like I did. The fact that they ended it properly after the second season is a huge plus point and this is something I would definitely recommend to anybody who love thrillers and can ignore small deficiencies and yeah, the writers definitely believed in the phrase 'love is blind and stupid'.",Money_heist
117,SimonSaysSmallScreen,Bad. Dumb and bad. Just really bad.,1/10,26 April 2020,"Let's start with the initial premise: occupying the mint, printing up 2.4 billion in 50-Euro notes, and stealing them. That many notes would weigh 43,200 Kg and occupy a minimum of 29 standard CEN-pallets (each stacked a ridiculous 2.7 meters high), which is five more than will fit in a 40-ft container. The narration tells us they printed 200 million in the first 8 hours, so the whole lot would take 96 hours (4 days), and then it all has to be cut, stacked, wrapped and loaded. So they have to continue their occupation for, say, all together 7 days without the police taking the standard step of CUTTING OFF THE POWER. Then they have to get all that bulk removed, taken to another location, and then what are they going to do with it? Divide it amongst them? Each of them then has at least two pallets, 3,000 Kg, of bulk to carry away?This is like some late-night stoner idea that nobody with any sense ever intervened in. Are these people from the 1950's? I mean, who steals paper money, anymore? How do they think they'll ever use it? Bank notes have serial numbers, and the word will go out immediately. No bank anywhere will ever accept them in deposit. They cannot be laundered. Anyone with a layman's common sense sees immediately that the whole premise is absurd. It is sweet irony indeed that the author of such a laughably impracticable idea be known as ""The Professor.""Then there's the stilted, hackneyed dialogue, the clumsy character development, the lazy action sequences. And this is all in the first three episodes. I don't understand my fellow reviewers complaining they ""wasted their time"" on three seasons of this. I'm ending this agony now.",Money_heist
118,Diablo1616,Surprisingly fantastic,8/10,7 April 2020,"It's a well thought out story with vast opportunities to explore and have fun with from many angles of the storyline, and the writers don't disappoint, not missing a beat. Heck, they found angles I wouldn't have realized were there! The writing is clever in that it never gives you enough to anticipate anything that might happen next. You honestly can't fathom how a character is going to get out of a particular pickle, and you just sit there waiting for the train to crash and the groan to escape your stomach, but somehow the writers keep it on the track. I look forward to seeing Part 5 . I've also grown very, very fond of all the actors, even those who might not have strong acting skills. Only good writing can compensate for that. Given that all are probably Spanish actors, I'm going to have to look up other things they have done to enjoy them further. All the characters behind doing the heist are fun to watch.I really like how well the show causes you to at first like one of the key characters, a lot, and then grow to hate them and feel they are disposable, unable to picture their significance to any later episodes except to annoy you, but then ... suddenly, magically, you're liking them again! And even happy that the writers figured out a way to do that. It's as absurd as a few of the scenes and story lines are, but somehow after a groan or two they magically worked, often with a good laugh.I'm not giving storyline details like other reviews are. I feel that it's best to not know much going in other than the series' description. And the previews on Netflix show scenes from other seasons, which take place in a very different location with a very different angle, so I'm intrigued to reach those parts of the story. The storyline really is something fun to imagine

120,fjmsoftware,Should've stopped after season 2,6/10,4 December 2021,"Show seemed clever enough at first, but the quality went down over time, to the point that season 5 had none of the good parts of the first seasons left, it was just a soap opera with unnecessary screaming and drama and flashbacks, and no more believable plot twists left, and no more reason to root for the thieves left either. It got unwatchable by the end, basically.Can't recommend the whole thing, just watch the first 2 seasons and then stop wasting your time. The ending doesn't make it all worth it, they just kept making unnecessary seasons for the profit (which is ironic, considering how one of the early attractions was its robinhood-esque element).Happy it's finally over so I don't have to hear any more undeserved hype about it every time a new season starts.

A suspenseful plot implacably unfolding, a lot of unexpected twists. Refreshing storyline unlike most other movies or series about bank robberies. Professor gave justice to his role. What a legend. You'll get addicted to the show and you'll start admiring some characters while hating the others. It's not just a movie or a script. It is a wonderful work as a philosophy. There is a great slap in the capitalist system.

I highly recommend (as with anything in a foreign language) to watch it with subtitles instead of dubbed voices...it's the only way to get the full emotion of each actor, and it's especially necessary for this intense show.I have only watched the first two seasons, but it felt complete for me (and I assume it was originally for the writers as well), so I might leave it there, as it sounds like season 3 wasn't great and season 4 was awful.

Also quite interesting with a Spanish series. Fiorst sesaon starts out well with thge staging of a quite clever heist. Season two felt just too drawn out without adding any particular to the intrigue. Season three basically becomes a copy of first season, a new heist in a quite similar setting. It would have been much more interesting if the story had been much more around their lives as fugitives out in the world. After a while I lack complexity, and the characters are very shallow and stereotype. Overall acting is quite average, no real stars to shine. I kept watching all three seasons and was a little disappointed in the end. I had expected more. No sure if I will spend time in the next season (which I am quite sure they will make).

127,TheProteanGirl,A fair review among many extremes,8/10,22 March 2020,"I rate this show an 8, not for its quality, but because when I watched it I undeniably enjoyed the action and romance. It reminded me a lot of Breaking Bad/Dexter in the sense that it was an endless mistake/fix mistake/mistake/fix mistake loop where we are hoping the main character, el profesor, doesn't get caught and identified.Before I list some stuff (because a lot of reviews did a far better job than me of listing flaws and plot holes in depth) I want to mention that this show might've been better if instead of filming it as the robbery happening, then the occaisonal flashbacks, they should've opened with the robbery first episode then spent a season going through how they planned it, then the next the execution of the robbery, then the next the boiling point/being caught or whatever. I think that directing approach would've made it better because the bits-and-pieces we get of flashbacks, yes are well placed throughout, but make us not really relate to the characters as much. I fell that should've been built upon first.As for the flaws, I have a hard time believing any police force, unless amature, would mess up this much. The whole thing with Angel leaving voivemails that were coincidentally delivered everywhere except where it counts was super fake. The fact the profesor had a chance to fix each of those mistakes is unlikely, like he would have to physically be in so many places at once to do that and it doesn't add up. The main girl, tokyo, had no place in that team. She's super erratic and never used logic once. I don't know what the profesor saw in her that would help them considering he's so smart. The shoot downs between police and thieves didn't make sense. They were always injured everywhere except fatal organs and how the hell did tokyo get in with that bike? It made no sense, like they missed everything on her, not even a tire was grazed by a force of trained ops.What I like though were the love-triangles, the actors played well (except for some side characters like Ariadne and also Tokyo). Me and my boyfriend have so far enjoyed binging it very much. I haven't enjoyed a show like this in a while (relative to others) but it is far from perfect.

131,richard-fieldhouse,Is it possible to pull off the ultimate victimless crime?,9/10,17 May 2018,"The Professor hopes so. He's been planning obsessively for years, refining his father's original scheme as a kind of homage. He's an unusual criminal - unworldly, socially gauche, possibly a little autistic - but his planning has been meticulous and he also carefully assembles and trains a team for the job. Like the plans for 9/11, but without the deaths and destruction - at least that's the theory. Maybe human nature has some surprises in store for him.This is a beautifully executed and original Spanish series that's now available subtitled on Netflix. Acting from all the leads is very strong and they've taken the time available in a series to add some depth and background to the characters. The structure and suspense of the plot are sustained through to the end of the second series. Few things turn out to be simply black and white. There's no getting away from it that the Spanish sometimes talk fast and following the subtitles isn't always easy, but it's worth the effort. There are a few mistakes in the translation and some phrases seem a little jarring and unnatural in the English, but this is my only small issue with an excellent series. 9/10.",Money_heist

A lot has already been said on the acting, which is impeccable. But what's most remarkable is the writing, so inventive and clever.I never thought that the story would keep being captivating for 13 episodes, but it did. And then some...In the beginning, you think it would be wrapped up in 2 or 3 episodes, what more can they come up with?But it never gets boring, not for a minute. 13 hours later, I'm under the spell!Well done, y'all !

And now 3 seasons to get out of bank of spain. Give me a break and stop making your story longer you are ruining it.The moment I saw neymar in this series I knew this is going down, neymar and guess what they speak about "" football"". Stupid characters, literally tokyo said that"" professor didn't tell is the police will fire back "" what the hell. Gandia is immortal, Nairobi stayed alive for 6 episodes for no reason at all. Tokyo is so annoying, bad actor , and arturo is alive just to fill the episodes, all episodes must have arturo trying to do something and it doesn't move the story forward. Rio is a kid. Berlin was killed in season 2. For some reason we see him in a flashback literally every freaking episode.

For one, how detailed it is... typically USA show is alot of fluff/waste of time. This has psychological elements (what people will do/how will they react) to predict behavior, and create a plan based on that. It's blunt and true, Stockholm syndrome is real. Acting may have been a bit over the top but I can hardly judge since I didn't hear it in original tongue.Overall, enjoyable 20 hours, capped off by a great main theme song.10/10P.S I love netflix for buying quality shows in the world.

137,kiowhatta,Polished but frustratingly confused pacing,6/10,8 October 2019,"This series has quite a lot going for it. The problem is, it doesn't quite know what it wants to be.
A psychological heist- based thriller with in-depth characters or a character driven psychological heist based thriller.
It keeps switching from the tension of the unfolding heist to lingering almost pointless exchanges between characters that left this viewer confused and frustrated.
The sub-plot of cat and mouse between Raquel and 'the Professor was enticing and thrilling enough to keep me watching - up until the end of the first season.
Then the logic and plot became too ludicrous to bare.
After investing so much emotion into the success of the heist gang only to have it all predictably fall apart left me feeling empty and frustrated.
I was hoping this series wouldn't cop out to the clich√© of 'crime doesn't pay', particularly after developing the characters on both sides of the law as morally ambiguous, but I was wrong.
Despite the slick production, innovative writing and some intriguing characters I was left with a feeling similar to extreme buyers remorse.

It's easy to fall into the trap of it being a 'robin hood' type movie and maybe that was the intention of the writers. But it fails because the plot lines are ludicrous, it's full of holes, the acting is one-dimensional and, worst of all, one can't feel empathy, or even care, what happens to the characters.

And as always each season has meaningful and worthful endings.
The main questions is - Why do we still on the robbers side? Well answer for that would take some pages because its hecking crazy.
And 5th season is coming so lets hope for thw best.
You can also watch this series with only 1st two seasons its still worth it.

I personally thinking this show is overhyped. Now, Second thing is Money Heist (La casa de lapel) Season 1 (Part 1 & Part 2) is very interesting and awesome. But after season 2 (Part 3 & Part 4) is pathetic all the way story wise, character wise and direction wise totally messed up. I Literally feel watching the show all characters are annoying and irritating in a some way except the professor & Berlin. Tokyo character is very irritating in whole TV Series. And the main thing is you know what police, CNI and intelligence agency is very dumb whole 4 parts that's a really very funny thing in this show for me. How it's possible can you explain this show creators how all polices and security's are dumb. Seriously, That's why This TV Series is mind-blowing and overhyped. In My Opinion, Those People's said this great show even the comparison the all time great show breaking bad I said those people's this is not great show this is the only overrated and average show. If you have a lot of time so watch this series but I suggest you only 2 part is good otherwise rest of parts disappointed. Last 2 parts overdramatic and unreasonable twists. So, I hope part 5 better than last part. Last I hope this time this show completely end. My Rating

157,jwpicton,Worth a look - spoilt by absurd timeline,6/10,27 April 2020,"I have to say that despite some somewhat corny characters I am enjoying this show. It keeps you wanting to know what next, what's going to happen with him or her, how's this out that situation going to turn out etc etc so full marks there.
However, the gigantic elephant in the room is the timeline. Some films and series play around with their timeline for effect and can be worked out in one's own mind, albeit with a little artistic licence here and there.
But this is on another planet....
I am on episode 4 season 2 (the 17th episode!) and they are only 3 days and 11 hours into the heist! This is simply NOT PLAUSIBLE.
With all that had happened; people's recovery rates from being shot (for gods sake), love affairs and even the amount of travel and moving around that has gone on, it is completely absurd that we are expected to believe that this has all happened during the course of 3 and a bit days (minus at least a few hours sleep here and there).
IMHO it is a massive oversight and from that point of view renders the production a laughing stock.
The sense of time passing and how that is handled is critical to most productions, and specifically to those that specifically track the time/duration of the happening.
On this, they have completely failed. They would have been better off leaving it up to the viewer to assume how long it had gone on for.
If you can ignore this aspect its quite a good series.",Money_heist

160,EntropyFashion,Overacting and Horrible Voice Dubs,4/10,11 September 2019,"This started as a pretty intriguing storyline - sort of like Inside Man or a larger Dog Day Afternoon but in order to stretch it out they killed the momentum of the narrative and then started making characters act in stupid ways just to keep the story going.
Because we spend so much more time with these actors, their weaknesses become glaring. Horrible overacting but the English voice dubs are as bad as the kind you would get in bad Kung fu movies of the 70's.

162,keenast,"Extremely soapy, only enjoyable if 'logic' is of no importance",5/10,14 March 2021,"Well, kinda like a gossip girl heist movie combination. Nothing makes much sense. A bunch of boy's and girl's scouts bank robbers outgunning the military and along the way open a well-run hospital during their gold melting enterprise. A quintessential 6-pack movie. Dialog can't decide if we want to be really stupid or just pretentious.Camerawork is good, production design. is good, acting is good, writing is 'smart and braindead'. First two seasons are fine, then Netflix bought it and from then on with a big money injection and hundreds of thousands spent for public relations it goes downhill quickly and endlessly repetitive.

164,kingx-90803,Very dissapointing,5/10,18 November 2021,******SPOILERS ALeRT ****This show should be easily a 9 out of 10. I very loved it until the 2nd heist came along so i duno which seasons is that but i think its probs season 4 n 5.Too much gun battle scenes with no one ever dying barely and everyones supposedly has trained to have good aim but can only hit small tiny targets like a knife held in the air But they cant seem to hit anyone when theirs a group of them standing side to side while facing their opponents Face to face . I mean even an idiot who never fired a gun could hold the trigger down and just spray left to right n will for sure hit the multiile Targets standing infront of him in line lol. Its like their standing face to face to shoot at each other but their Holding guns what? Sideways??? Or they aimin at the ceiling?? Or the ground?? Lmao. The director n the person coordinating these gun battles are terrible.It was such a good show until seemingly the professor aways has so many many backup plans even for things he didnt even know would occur lol and he seems to know al without ever looking at any blueprints during heated battle moments to strategize attack formations n plans. Even when he does look its like he grabs the blue prints n sets it down n bam 2 seconds later i got the plan!They try to hard to incorporate heart felt n lovey moments that its ruining the quality of the scenes. Its like their taking 9 star rated scenes n then decides to force a love moment inbetween a gunfight n then it just makes it even less realistic n then the quality plummets cause of these terrible decisions.This was a groundbreaking show honestly until they started dragging things out too long and their ideas to introduce viewers to the characters pasts into scenes becomes convoluted and messy. Moments of their pasts that just dont connect with the scene at all n actually take away from the moment because of it being added in.Very dissapointed! The only thing good is the Acting but if u want quality writing n directing i would say stop watching once the first heist ends. It had a very good ending till they made more seasons.,Money_heist
165,johnny-89987,It was not supposed to be 5 seasons!,7/10,21 September 2021,"This series was made for 2 seasons by the Spanish network, but with the purchase of the rights of the series by Netflix, this series continued for another 3 seasons, and the reason is completely clear. To earn more money but at the cost of serial drop. Because the author and creator of the series is not present in seasons 3 and 4, and while the story of the robbery ends at the end of season 2, they (Netflix) continue the series at any cost and cause its destruction at the end of season 4. Now they want to finish in season 5 and get rid of it !

Everything that made both parts of series one so watchable and gripping is missing here. This goes from long boring scenes where nothing happens and there are sheaves of tedious and unnecessary dialogue to the absolutely ridiculous, Two of the men looking for a trained killer who has vowed to murder them are distracted because they are spending time discussing ex girlfriends. And then when the killer turns up four of the ""heroes"" fire off hundreds or probably even thousands of machine gun bullets directly at him from close range and he walks away.

So if you really want to start watching it, I suggest you to stop after the second part.I think 2 stars out of 10 is the right score, given the fact that only the first 2 seasons make sense and pretty sure they will go up to 10 seasons.

I don't if it was just her character , or she's naturally such a terrible actress. Like seriously everyone does a fine job, but her character and her own performance are absolutely the worst. She alone is the reason that brings down the show many times. I wished Tokyo was dead in the very first episode of S1.
She'll pose unnecessarily, overact everytime she's on screen, her dialogue delivery is the absolute worst, and she holds the gun like a teenager would do, kind of a show off. While every other aspect of the show is class apart, Ursula(Tokyo) is ridiculous both actor and the character.

The seductive presence of the Professor, always composed, with his razor-mind always one step ahead of things, now has turned into a conventional man heading a theft as many others.
The very well paced and interesting relationship with the hostages now has become sparse, thinner and less relevant.
The cliches and flagship gestures which were innovative in the previous seasons now seem an overcooked repetition of resources in a less effective context.
The fascinating cat-mouse liaison between the Professor and the Inspector now has been replaced by the typical bedroom rows and marital power quarrels.
And then the disgusting, terribly acted pregnant detective, what was that character mean to add? In any case, she hasn't done it.Instead of the good things, they have injected the show with a contemporary American idea of what ""action"" means: frantic, blasting music overscoring every dialogue and every scene at top volume (you have to turn it down and up every minute because it's really bothersome) and frantic people shouting their lungs out at every sentence. No nuances, no finesse this time.Also, the ""ideology"" element and the politically correct agenda seem so force-fed and poorly justified that they make you sigh.

I wish there were more tv shows like this but not exactly like this because It's already unbeatable. La Casa De Papel has set the highest record in its class.

184,trcky1,Great writing and performances S1 & S2,10/10,21 April 2020,"Well, I only finished S1 and S2 as i think that's prob where the original production ended. I'm guessing S3 and S4 are cash-in seasons so i won't ruin the series for myself.But really, this series does a great job of investing in the characters with all of their strengths and flaws, the crime sequences are meticulously crafted story and the plot devices is thoroughly explained. With as complex a plot a this one, if course there are gonna be a couple of bandages to smooth out the logic, but compared to anything else I've seen, they're not too objectionable or groan-worthy.Fun series, great performance, and great storytelling make this series a must-see.

185,joekez-50844,Soap Opera or Crime Drama,6/10,19 April 2020,"Seasons 1 & 2 are not as bad as seasons 3 & 4. It's like a bunch of college kids decided to pull off a heist with their professor who apparently, is so intimidating with his flawless plan, that the police just give into all his demands. None of the criminals look convincing at all. Everyone in the show is just falling in love. There are some twists and turns in seasons 1 & 2 that don't make the show unbearable to watch but seasons 3 & 4 is a joke. Overall, it would make for a good soap opera but definitely not a good crime drama.

186,deesestone,Dumb and Dumber,1/10,5 September 2019,"I just don't get how this series got good reviews -- it is beyond stupid and every character unsympathetic, the worst of all of them being El Professor, alias Mr. Smarty-Pants -- supposedly always ahead one step -- not very hard to do with the dumbies he has to contend with. Close behind him in obnoxiousness and cluelessness is Ms Inspector who succumbs to Professor's charms, such as they are and frankly I don't see them at all - from his goofy glasses to his bad body to his Clark Kent alter ego, he is Yeccch. Honestly I was routing for his demise or capture at every turn, knowing that just wasn't in the cards as presumably we are supposed to like him. And what is it with his crocodile tears every time one of his gang dies --boo hoo we see the tears coursing down his face and 3 seconds later he is smiling, happy as can be over another scam he has perpetrated over the bunch of Keystone Kops he is up against. All of them seem to get over the death of their compadres pretty quick including the son of the father-son duo, can't remember his name.3 seconds after his beloved papa dies, he is kissing his girlfriend, the bank secretary and smiling at getting out. The whole crowd, kidnappers, hostages and cops -- bad news all of them, and may I say -- never saw any of them take a shower during the whole series yet they fornicate at will, clothes on or off -- take your pick.",Money_heist

The last lead character to die deserved better, that character didn't carry the weight of this series on their shoulders to be ended that way (Tokyo.)The end to the entire series was thrilling and big, and watchers can definitely sigh in relief that it's over (or maybe not, there are going to be spinoffs: a South Korean one, and another). The end to season 2 was more impactful, believable and memorable, but after the journey watchers have travelled, it's definitely an emotional and beautiful end.There's no need to rave about how phenomenal the series is, this has been a known fact since 2017 (or 2019 when it gained international success).NB: why don't international series get nominated for Emmys (not that international Emmys thingy) is the Emmys for the UK and US alone? Because Money Heist definitely deserved an Emmy nom... It's literally impossible that a UK or US show would have this much success and fame and not have an Emmy nom.",Money_heist

The second season was good, but the third season... fk Hollywood. The music, the actors, the camera work, how everything was put into scene, the pace even those filler Dialoges between the roles, was just awesome for me. Why im so raving about the third season? When i Read there will be a third installment, my First reaction was... oh man come on please, stop trying to milk a dead cow, its hopeless. But everything was put a on a whole new Level compared to the last season, I even laughed. 50kg artichoke, no one needs them.

201,type-a1pha,Avoid.,3/10,22 April 2020,"Avoid this series unless you hate yourself and have time to waste. It is a mess, there's no way around it. From the absurd premise, to the clumsy execution and the mono-dimensional, stereotypical characters, there's little to nothing in terms of true enjoyment to be had. Every episode is just a series of contrived turn of events where every main character acts in the worst, most unintelligible way possible. There's no nuance, no real interesting psychological trait, every single character is encaged in a stereotype; everyone is annoying, bland, trivial, over melodramatic. And the story is even worse. Despite its desire to be seen as smart and clever, it's just so absurd and forced that the viewer is left speechless. The police are basically dummies, they play no significant role in how things turn out and if the protagonists weren't the most detached, oblivious, nonsensical fictional beings ever, the series would end after four episodes. Save yourself from this.

212,siennacolucci,WHY THEY KILL MY FAVS SO MUCH??,9/10,22 September 2021,"Okay okay okay hear me out,,, this show is seriously so good but like only if you like shows that leave you highly stressed and very anxious the entire time. There is always twists and turns and something to keep it exciting. The characters are either SO loveable or so hateable (arturo) and my problem with this is that they KILL OFF my top-most favs (with the exception of berlin, bye he can go he was literally a predator, which is annoying because he still somehow gets more screentime than a lot of alive characters). Like last season they let nairobi go... and for WHAT?? SHOCK FACTOR?? And THEN during the newest episodes, they make me like,,, even LOVE, tokyo's character and its so upsetting because like ... they kill her off. Why cant they do this to like?? Idk?? Bogota or something?? Like she died in the best way possible but GOD this was so hard to watch. Im glad theyre ending it this season so there isnt any unnecessary storylines made up just to keep the show going. Anyways i still recommend even though it shatters my soul likeeee every time.",Money_heist
213,ilawadehla,"The pace is slow, and the plot is divided into three routes.",8/10,15 April 2020,"Two routes occur in real time: the police and the professor team.
Memory Routine: Teach the past of the characters in the team, some memories, some high lights that happened when they were training.
Some people say that it can be made into a movie, but also dragged on for two seasons.
I like this way of shooting details, shooting the past, and portraying the characters in more detail.
Several important figures involved in the team of professors, each of whom has a painful past to look at.
I probably also like the oddball, does not follow the common sense card, does not shoot ""three views are very straight"" the movie director ~",Money_heist
214,eugene-alexander,Loved it! A great movie!,10/10,2 June 2018,"Congratulations to everyone involved in this excellent series. It has a total of 999 minutes, which is like watching a movie 16,6 hours long. Many scenes were obviously ""stretched"" to fill in time. If it was a normal movie it would be trimmed down to 2,5 hours the most. Putting that aside, the scenario was partly taken from the Inside Man (2006), but with many more twists to the story. I still think the scenario was excellent and well played out.One of the best series up-to-date that I have seen, and I have seen many. This is a ""must see"" movie and worth your time. It was so good that I hope they do NOT make another episode.Special thanks to √Ålex Pina!

217,rune-andresen,Season 1 and 2 very entertaining- 3&4 Stupidity,8/10,14 September 2021,"I rate the first two seasons 8. They are pretty good and entertaining. Maybe stupid and silly yes - but pretty damn good.Season 3 & 4 are cartoonish, plot holes like a Swiss cheese, misplaced characters, a parody of the first two seasons, soap opera with a rambo like persons it's impossible to kill despite unlimited bullets, very stupid police men - like a bad comedy. Only two of one billion bullets made a hit by the way. The story boarding is very bad as well, and makes no sense most of the time. Rating 2.

218,james_norman1981,Overwhelmingly frustrating,3/10,17 June 2018,"SpoilersMoney Heist (English translation) is a well made, well acted, expensive looking production which does a great job of balancing tension, action and character. You get into the heist almost immediately and, unlike many shows, the flashbacks to planning sessions and earlier episodes in the characters' lives rarely overstay their welcome. It's an interesting premise, the bank robbers (in this case Spanish Royal Mint robbers) are the ones who need to buy time in order to complete their heist, and they are the ones deliberately delaying any possible resolution with the police rather than the other way round.Yes it's not hugely novel. There are clear influences from any number of heist movies, from the senior cop talking to the senior robber of Heat, to the shadowy 'how to infiltrate your enemy' of any number of spy films. And, if you've watched the Spike Lee Joint Inside Man, a part of you must wonder at what point do the creators of Money Heist start paying Russell Gewirtz royalties, not to mention Clive Owen and Denzel Washington.So what's the problem? Well, there's one major problem: the characters' motivation. But it's an issue so glaring that I gave up on the show half way through season two, feeling like I'd be conned out several hours of my life (it certainly takes it time in certain scenes).Why is this? Well, from the start, it's suggested that the heist crew are a highly motivated, tightly knit group who have lived, breathed and bonded with each other for months in preparation for the heist. They have total trust in their man on the outside, the Professor, and absolute faith in his plan. The Professor himself is portrayed as an outright genius who has anticipated all of the counter moves by the police, to the point where early episodes of the show make seeming disasters turn into major triumphs for the heist crew. It's very well done and appears totally organic.Which is why the Professor shooting off in order to cosy up to the lead investigator of the police, the woman running the counter operation, is so inexplicable. What is he doing? Why is he repeatedly exposing himself to the exact person who is best placed to identify him? When a single repeated phrase or unexpected piece of knowledge could reveal him in a heartbeat? And, by all that's holy, what on EARTH is the senior officer in charge of the negotiations doing drinking alcohol in bars, meeting a new man whose surname she doesn't even know, and sleeping with him DURING the heist!? There's no planet where that kind of behaviour is understandable and it causes the escape of multiple hostages and the death of the least characterised character in the whole show (seriously, he barely has five words during his entire involvement).And this craziness extends to all the other characters. Tokyo is setup as this badass fiery warrior who flies off the handle a lot and seems to relish cutting off her nose to spite her face. Why is she selected for the heist? She has no special skills other than making unforgivable errors and she breaks all the cardinal rules: no personal details, no intimate relationships. Her lover, Rio, oscillates wildly from puppy faced devotion to Tokyo followed by adolescent pique and regularly gives away vital information to the police and the hostage. Helsinki, the hard, gay, Serbian soldier who should be tough as nails and friendly as cancer is portrayed as a great big teddy bear. Denver, admittedly only present because his dad needs him there, shoots from 'stick it out till the bitter end' to 'we must leave now' whenever the show needs a second crazy robber to mess things up. And Moscow, his father, disappears for episodes at a time, but turns up in order to have a panic attack and get someone shot, before disappearing again. Critics of this piece will say Moscow has a task to do and that's why he's off screen, but that's no excuse to make him disappear for episodes at a time, that's just bad writing.Meanwhile Nairobi is initially one of the few robbers keeping it together, but starts doing the same moronic actions midway through season two because the writers think 'we need someone to do something really stupid now and we've already pushed the other characters too far.' Which leaves us with Berlin. Inexplicably this rapist psychopath is by far the most sympathetic character throughout, maintaining the same set of principles (faith in the plan balanced by a desire to survive) from the beginning to the point where I stopped watching. And he gets repeatedly blindsided by every other robber, including the Professor, comprehensibly failing to do their job. And the less said about the opposition (going through various stages of lovesickness, horniness, sexism, aggression, and occasionally stunning insights from a completely irrational basis) the better. Plus don't get me started on why the loudest, most awkward hostage, who has ADMITTED to being part of an escape attempt, continues to be allowed to wonder around unsupervised by the robbers.All this adds up to one thing: bad writing, which is a real shame in a show with a very strong premise that is put together genuinely well. This is one of those programs in which the writers make characters do things not because the characters would do them, but because the show needs the error in order to generate tension. My expectation is that, by the conclusion of season two, all the questions about why the Professor has seduced the lead investigator will be answered and everything will be neatly wrapped up, with a few deaths to make things painful for the viewer. But I can't keep watching a show that doesn't respect my intelligence and I genuinely believe you shouldn't either.Do yourself a favour. Give Money Heist a miss.",Money_heist
219,Britinmiami,Its a boring day time soap opera with terrible acting and horrible voiceovers - ugh,1/10,27 August 2019,"Don't waste your time with this show. I believe that someone from this show got on here and gave them a ton of high-level reviews. The show is so terrible that it does not make any sense that anyone would say it was good... It's a very weak story line and the voiceover choice of actors is awful. The acting is really bad, and I would guess you will never see any of these Spanish actors in anything UK or US based. You should do yourself a favor and watch ""The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo"" then watch an episode of this garbage and you will have gone from gold to trash.A friend told me about this series... After about 3 episodes it was obvious that the writing was bad. It got worse and worse after each episode and felt like it was written for bored middle school kids with no imagination. The holes in the story are awful and the acting is bad. Every episode felt more like a daytime soap opera. The storyline got worse and worse with ridiculous outcomes. I read one of the reviews on IMDB and I laughed out loud with some of the stupid things the police could have done to end this boring kidnapping quickly! For example, ""Turn off the lights in the building"" - LOLThe main female actor and her role are ludicrous, and the script given to the mother is unbelievably bad. What is also bad is the music which reminds me of those terrible daytime soap operas. Can you imagine you walking into your house with some random guy you just met, and your mother asks you if you made love last night? Really! Well that si straight from the show - ugh.

222,imdb-58910,This is about first and second part,10/10,7 February 2021,"Many people speak about this series Money heist/ la casa de papel, if it is whether overrated, or just a waste of time. For me, it's one of the best series and I couldn't stop watching it since I have seen a first episode.
This series contains action, crime drama and mystery. In the beginning all looks like an ordinary robbery but over time it becomes an extremely high level robbery. The professor who organized this robbery at national mint, had everything figured out in details step by step. Of course, he needs some couple of people who will go to the mint. He tries to find people who would be determined to be there and who would have nothing to lose, because it's dangerous job. The whole story takes place in the national mint where robbers don't want to steal money, but they want to print them. They need a lot of time for printing them, which professor is trying to get for them. In the beginning cooperation and relationships between robbers and hostages are not the best but over time it's getting better. The police also play a big role here, they trying to stop them but failing.
Every actor had a perfect role that suited them but my favorite character is Professor, he is like 300iq player in some game. I like that he calculates with all the mistakes and he tries to avoid them.",Money_heist

Moreover, over the top acting and situations ... its like half of kidnaped women wana makeout with their kidnappers...
I have to admit though some ideas are well placed and seem realistic enough
like predicting some moves of abducted people, escape by some etc. but again scene shift back gears to Soap opera like atmosphere rather than a thriller.
Those who have any hopes of Socialistic ideas or philosophic undertones {as many reviews say} will be disappointed.

This is a TV show that you watch if there isn't anything else on Netflix. I got super bored, skipped some scenes, it is foolish and a super waste of time... I am watching Season 2 now hopefully it will get better.

237,rahulwadhwani-52617,Money Heist is a Must Watch!,9/10,7 March 2021,"#OneWordReview #MoneyHeist Fantastic.
After hearing a news about Hindi Dubbing of Money Heist on #Netflix. I started watching. Trust me it was fantastic Hindi Dubbing. I binged watched Season 1 & 2. Both the seasons are Related to each other & this series ended with a Fantastic Climax in Season 2. For me it is definitely one of the best series of Netflix till I watched Season 2. The performance of complete Cast. Whether it was Nairobi, Denver, Moscow, Tokyo, Rio, Helsinki Berlin. For the Character Berlin is treat to watch. Such a powerful acting by Pedro. The main character Professor is the lifeline of the show. No one can better act than @alvaromorte .Raquel was also the best character of the show. There are so many powerful performances from the rest of the cast too. Tha concept is so fresh. I love the way they direct both the seasons. We are completely connected with each character. The BGM is also fantastic. The fighting sequences specially the gun shots in season 2 finale were awesome. This series is bit so long. But you can avoid this.

238,rahulwadhwani-52617,Till the first 3 seasons Money Heist is epic.,9/10,12 March 2021,"#OneWordReview #MoneyHeist3 Fantastic.
For me it's the best season among the all 3 seasons. From the beginning till the end it completely on fast paced. Starting scene of 140 Million Euro Rain from the balloon & the climax Suspense just blown my mind. This time the robbery is even bigger, new players joined they also brought some new fun in this robbery! This time again I must say I love professor even more & again Berlin is above than all other characters. The fighting sequences are the best in this series specially last 10 minutes scene. BGM is Outstanding. Completely a must watch series for all. Can't wait to watch out season 4.

241,Nummer9,"To long, but good",6/10,18 November 2018,"I really enjoyed the show. This was good entertainment, with a really decent storyline and great acting. But it was way to long and you can feel that they streched the show artificially to get more episodes out of it. Three episodes less per season would have done the trick to keep up the excitement and i would have easily given 8 stars.But all together the show is fresh, entertaining and absolutly worth binge watching.

243,DocHolmberg,One of the most entertaining series ever,10/10,25 September 2020,"First of all - here's a newsflash to all the people here who suddenly have become cops and criminal experts and giving bad reviews because of the ""unrealistic events"" in this show:
You seem to be missing that this is not a documentary or something based on a true story - this is a fictional series which should be allowed to have some elements that is a little to advanced to be true.
You would'nt categorize Star Wars or Lord of the rings as ""unrealistic"" because of spaceships and wizards now would you?
With that said - after a slow start this one really picks it up at the end of the first season and turns in to one of the most entertaining shows ever to come ot ouf Europe.
Smart, fast paced, nice twists and turns, good acting and well executed all together. Can't wait for season 5.
And people please - watch it with the original spanish soundtrack. The dubbed experience just ruins everything.

250,gogga1011,Not flawless but better than most Netflix garbage,5/10,6 April 2020,"One day I was tempted to see what's new on Netflix. I searched and listed tons of boring, stupid generic series (mostly in 5 categories: teenage school mystery, vampires, zombies, superheroes and drug dealers etc.). Then, suddenly, out of nowhere came some show with short but intrigue name ""Money Heist"" (and picture of Dali-masked people in red). I didn't know anything about that tv series and thought - another boring stupid Netflix show with amateur directors and wannabe actors, but after only 5 minutes I was deeply dragged into story. Interesting scenario, very lively characters, interesting (natural) dialogues and very well dosed scenes which continue to pull you deeper and turn you in to everhungry tv-zombie who wants only one more episode of ""La Casa de Papel"" (original name). The first and second season were brilliant, full of energy and well-tempted tempo, but the 3rd and 4th season (parts) are clearly worsen. It is obvious that authors wanted to repeat intense action from previous parts, but most of episodes are pretty generic and screenplay is full of stupidity, also we can see that most actors are actually very bad in their profession (over-acting). Especially bad are ""Helsinki"" and ""Tokyo"", she is cute but acting is not for her. But, to keep shocking the viewers they injected ""new age"" characters like transexual man (although played by woman, because transexual man can never be beautiful like woman, no matter how he try) and some men (all are sociopaths in screenplay) who passionately hugging and kissing each other. It is obvious it is commanded from above that every video today, movie or series has to have some nice, very emotional gay/lesbian characters. Personally I don't care for them, but it is became clear propaganda and it ruins most of shows because it is forced in to. Hope that the 5th part of this show would be the last because there is really nothing more to tell. Story has to be concluded while it is worth. More seasons would devastate it and turn ""la Casa"" into cheap, repeating spanish soap-opera. EDIT: 5th season is the worst. More stupid and surplus dialogues. Action scenes are pure comedy - granades which don't explode for a whole minute, millions of bullets no magazanie changed etc. Etc... Please, finish this stupidity while you can.",Money_heist

In its first few seconds I realized that this is a special project. I could feel the energy, thrill, intelligence, and camaraderie soaked into the story and production. There is attention to detail, during the telling of this story of group of life-worn thieves assembled by the incredible, ""Professor"". Without revealing too much, I will say this character of ""The Professor"" is outstanding, fantastic, and so fun to watch. His quiet demeanor combined with the brilliance of his mind engaged in the intense challenges created by the heists at hand. I would recommend this series to all.

256,mrsazz,"Watch the first seasons, maybe...",3/10,28 December 2021,"This show is highly overrated. It started out trying to be very clever, but devolved eventually into a driveling mess where the same type of drama is repeated way too many times in different fashion.My biggest issue is that I find every single character in this series to be despicable lowlifes. That fact makes it difficult to watch, as it very quickly becomes irrelevant to me which side wins or loses.To those that disagree. Please analyze the actions of each character, and ask yourself what the REAL consequences of those actions are. If every person on earth acted in the exact same way, what would happen? Well... nothing good.It doesn't help that the writing jump sharks, battle is over the top unrealistic, modern real-life tactics nowhere to be found, soap-opera drama between the main characters, and a synthetic and highly crafted script trying too hard to prop up bad people and make them heroes, when they clearly are not.While all people are scum here, some are hilariously evil to the point that it's just laughable. The writers set up unrealistic scenarios to wash their hands of evil actions performed by someone else, but it doesn't absolve them nevertheless.The politics of this show is shoved in your face so violently that is impossible to miss. Great for those that lean that way, but not for the rest of us.To the next team trying to create a clever ""heist"" show, remember this: As soon as someone hurts someone else either physically or emotionally, they ARE the bad guys no matter what you are desperately trying to convey to the audience. If they continue doing the same stuff over and over again, it's even worse.",Money_heist

This show is way behind on the curve, the writers seem to think they wrote a clever, smart script but in reality, they didn't. The main story line and sub-plots were uninspiring and boring to say the least! The characters are bland, one-dimensional, cliche, just simply uninteresting and for the most part annoying! There were several story arcs that I tried my best to get into but I just could not because I simply did not care for the characters! Bad writing is all to blame here! For it to get above 8.0 rating is mind boggling. This is horse manure story writing at its best! Don't watch this it will be just a waste of time. Trust me. And for the producers who think they made a well thought out tv series, think again! Your viewers are ten times smarter than this and can see right through all this garbage. Stop wasting both of our times, go back to school, re-invent yourself, and stop giving us this 5th grade writing!",Money_heist

262,joncase-48463,And So Megastars Are Born,10/10,9 December 2021,"To put it simply, it is superb. It has everything - action, suspense, drama, tension, love, tears, humour, utter daftness, a serious message, a ludicrous message. And that most important of things for a programme like this - a group of characters that, despite their many flaws, you fall for, like and want to win. Okay, and develop a wee crush for in a couple of cases!The acting, writing, production, make up, etc etc is first class. You really can tell that every single person that was involved in the making of this was dedicated to the final product.WELL DONE AND THANK YOU.

I thought nothing could beat prison break as its screen play and concept were great but this has been stunningly produced.It's not a family friendly series but with crime thriller and thieves you expect this type of lifestyle.Amazed and hooked cannot get enough, you grow to love the cast and heartbroken if something happens to them, however I love the stylised flashback which then reveal the plan and you still get to see your beloved cast.Someone needed to kill Mr Roman.

264,y-93230,Money heist,9/10,24 May 2020,"1. Start by thanking Netflix for inadvertently bringing the show back to life. (season 2 actually went down in quality compared to season 1.) 2. A uniform look and a familiar theme song are indeed crucial to becoming a cultural phenomenon, and anti-establishment resistance is a timeless theme, and it can be said that the people who decide on these concepts are very smart. 3. While shooting and writing scripts is full of unknown excitement for the actors, the opposite side of the double-edged sword is that some plots are obviously hasty and time-consuming. Let's shoot again when we are almost finished. 4. It was very touching to watch the whole cast pay so much effort for a little detail, and the actors were all very good actors, who performed their roles so impressively that they wanted to cry during the filming of Alba Flores. Because of peer pressure discussed by all of us in Europe, we decided to look at it. If we chase after it, we will get out of our emotions. We hope that this IP will not be over-exploited and have a good ending.

265,ukgreek,Just... bad,4/10,1 February 2021,"Maybe the good reviews are about the basic premise of the story, which is interesting and carries the series. But the scenes are so implausible, and the script reflects how little the writers/showrunner know of real human interactions. What makes it so much worse is the ridiculous misogyny. I see they have a couple of women writers, but it's mostly men, and it is absolutely laughable. I feel sorry for the women writers, it's never easy being a minority in a writers' room.

Season 1 and 2 was very fabulous but season 3 has quite disappointed me that's why i cut the ratings. Story and thrill that was created at its best. The series has taught us the possible best consequences of any event and how would we deal with it if that happens. Professor's acting was very nice. I wanted more some explanation to their plan instead action.Some of you wrote that something should not have been happened but whole series was a fantasy so we can not doubt that what and why that has been done by them untill unless logic is concerned. And all people thinks in a different way.One of the fabulous fantasy thiller web series. Worth watching. And highly recommended because of first and second seasons.

But no...the writters decided to make another splash of soap opera and unnecessary gay scenes.
I often have to use fast-forward because it's hard to do with drama, cringe and too much irrationality.
Here you can see the relationship between robbers and robbers, robbers and hostages and all other possible combinations which neither makes sense nor purpose. Just another soap opera that you can only watch if you turn off your brain.
It is a pity that the potential was not used.

278,bilalcansakalli,Best Heist Series,9/10,15 December 2021,"My opinion about the series is that it tells a story of rebellion. The anarchist view is a dominant factor. The first two seasons were extremely well done and made the finale. But Netflix saw the success of the series and bought the rights of the series and continued it. It broke the record for the first week of the TV series that were not broadcast in English. The element of rebellion against the state is the general theme of the series. The color palettes are both dark and light and they have achieved the harmony of this. The scenarios and plans were extremely clever, and I was stunned to hear these plans. There is a turmoil in the series due to the robbery, but besides this turmoil, the art aspect of the series is also excessive. If you want to watch a clever heist production, La Casa De Papel is for you.

The action moments in the series is one of the most thriller based emotionally heavy scenes that you can expect in television today. I'll rather have the enormous popularity and ground breaking critical acclaim speak for itself. Its a modern revelation which gave a new life to a genre that had been under seize for quite a while, i.e. heist genre, this series gave a new life to this genre, which resonate universal themes across the world.

They had the guy handpick and train these people, and he didn't think about what will happen when the cops get there? Get out of here!The show: Extremely slow paced and frankly not interesting. There's no sense of urgency or anything that made me want to root for the heist or the characters. There was no justification for the heist or why the characters wanted to get into heist. Ok I quit in early episode, but then there should have been at least 1 interesting character that made me wanna continue the show. Nope, not one. Nada.

The story and development is gripping and will glue you to your seat . Some developments are predictable if you think about them but there are always surprises , i've watched the whole season in 2 days and i couldn't get enough of it. Some say the acting was weak, not it was not weak, yes sometimes actors were overreacting but people complaining do not have the ability to enter the psyche of the people participating. If you were in such a treacherous situation, with hostages, the possibility of ruining your and other's life and any mistake can cost dearly then yes one would be shaking. The reason they say Berlin was a strong actor is simply down to his psychological profile. Plot holes? I have not noticed anything that has not been explained in one manner or another, yes there were some holes but this is a serial just enjoy it. I did not find the plot weak at all and every mistake by the robbers could have serious repercussions if not for lady luck playing its part, but eventually their luck might run out. I assume the hate comes from people who do not wish to read subtitles and play it dubbed which would ruin the whole experience. I never watch anything dubbed as it destroys the colour of any movie/serial. Por favor watch it in the original language",Money_heist

But.
While the beginning of the show was about a game against the police, starting season 2 the main plot movers are heroes taking idiotic decisions. Watching the show further from this point was a pain from, ironically, ""spanish shame"" and facepalms.The story follows 2 lines, basically. One inside the Royal Mint (that is robbed) and the one outside. While the outside story is overstretched, it's keeping the suspense and goes well. The one inside became a random-rolling of decisions. It's like, imagine you are on the edge of the cliff, afraid that it might collapse with you. So, instead of moving away from the edge, you start digging down, stomping, whining, just doing anything, but moving away. And do it from episode-to-episode. I just don't like watching the movies about idiots. There is a comedy genre for it.It's unfortunate the show couldn't live up to expectations, but the effort was great, for sure. It follows the standard pattern of the best ideas being used early, and inventing subpar story movers on the way. It happened to Lost, Prison Break, The Walking Dead before.",Money_heist

The show is virtually a 70 hour long heist. Parts 3 & 4 are essentially the same story as parts 1 & 2. I was hoping that by the end of part 2 we were done with the hostages & robbery, but no...It just started all over again but robbing a different target. It was painful to watch.Now, the flawed story-line aside, the writing was crap. The police protocols were HIGHLY unrealistic. No police in any developed nation conduct themselves this way. ie, shooting into a group of hostages in disguises because you ""assume"" that the one you're aiming at is the bad guy--The entire show is filled with ridiculous policing like this. It was terrible.I wish I could get my time back.

No logic in the action of the characters, they repeat the same cycles of mistakes they have done just an episode before. People get shot, loose a lot of blood, but in 4-5 hours they are back like nothing happened. So if you like realism, you can easily avoid this waste of time.

The voice-over from Tokyo is really annoying, and they try to make her a strong and brave character out of nowhere. She is obviously not that person. All along the series she showed what she is, a girl who only likes to have fun and not so much more.Some of the characters are incoherent as they have fears of pity things but they can assault a bank with no problem.Also, the entire series make an obviously apology to theft, showing it like ""justified"" and something good. A lame ""anti-system"" ideology in a millionaire Netflix series, the hypocrisy describes itself.The season 3 and 4 are like a corpse with no soul, made only for making money, even the acting declined here.

315,seymour_sp,"Great show, shame about the American dubbing",9/10,29 July 2019,"I've watched quite a few subtitled films and TV shows lately so I decided to be lazy and watch the dubbed version of this. I'm currently on S1 E4 and it's an excellent TV drama - strong characters, great story, high tension.OK, one expects American actors to do Netflix dubbing but, when it's all so obviously set in Spain, with several early references to euros as the currency to be stolen (*very* early - no spoiler there), do we really need to hear characters talking about ""Homeland"", ""State"", ""the DA"" and ""bucks""? Are Americans really so insular that they need to be fed familiar references for fear that anything vaguely foreign may turn them off?That's insulting to non-Americans and, I'd like to think, insulting to most Americans too.

317,st_scott-64920,Intelligence is the new sexy!,9/10,13 May 2020,"I feel like I'm watching a thrilling Hollywood blockbuster. The stereotype of the character professor is not uncommon from previous shows, movies, even novels, but what the show did is focus on details, different stages of the robbery, deep insight of contemplation, countermeasure deployment, plot twists and surprises. The whole show is a close and clear demonstration of dynamic shifts. The rhythm of the show is elastic and tasteful.",Money_heist
318,ylshu-92855,La Casa de Papel,9/10,10 April 2020,"In fact, it's a left-wing TV play with revolutionary themes. The whole robbery is a big metaphor. The people at the bottom fight against capitalism. The rhythm is great, the narration is proper, the foreshadowing is reasonable, the character is three-dimensional, the fighting wisdom fights bravely. It is a very wonderful story.

319,l-80790,This show's fans need mental medication !,2/10,17 December 2021,"1. Robbery at 1st place is never justifiable . Never! Imagine someone killed your mom and then that dude starts giving emotional justifications, would you melt and let him go off happily? That's exactly what Money Heist promotes. You kill national guards yet go absolutely unharmed. Ridiculous!!2. Season 1-2 was ok they did for entertainment purpose but from the Bank of Spain plot, it takes fking 3 seasons ! And why does it take so long?....the answer is there is no genuis better than Sergio and the armymen, policemen basically are clowns. Yeah only in ur dreams buddy! If you tell me that anything is possible in a fiction then I can even showcase a normal man lifting some house with one hand and say ""Hey it's absolutely OK it's a fiction "". Fiction just can't showcase anything they want.3. Extending on my 1st point, the final season gives justifications for the robbery . I have seen films where people are forced to kill/rob just because of emotional past or no support from law etc but then they never said that ""killing/robbery is justified"" even though he might be wronged in the past. Money Heist attempts to justify every wrong thing it does and you need to be in right mind to believe this can't be true.4. The climax of S5 is absolutely bizzare. The kind of agreement they make at the end makes me bang my head on a wall. I was like, I am done with such crap. Also, this Berlin's son is so forcefully put into this season it was never needed. The wife cheating angle adds nothing to the msin plot, only increases its time length unnecessarily.Overall, I know there are fans of a lot crap films/series and you can't explain these points to them they will still spit on your mouth and say ""No this show is the best "". Money Heist has a fan base like that which cannot give answers to my points I have mentioned . For people in their good mental state, I hope u understand my points and watch better shows available.",Money_heist
320,silasmrner,Seamless,10/10,16 May 2020,"It's a part of probability that a great many improbable things will happen. And this series proves that point. Since we must suspend our disbelief while engrossed in the story, Money Heist makes it easy with plausible plot twists that keep the viewer on the edge of the couch. Great production values, superior acting.

322,burakparlak,Nearly Best Heist Plot,7/10,8 August 2019,"In first season, especially in first episodes, it gets boring but after they start to action, it turn out to be a masterpiece of heist!1) Professor is the best character in series. He play very good and inherently.2) Plot is fastmoving and sometimes you really think they get busted. However, it amazes you after every scene and this adds excitement to it.3) Sex scenes, dirty talk and LGBT characters are not necessary. Actually, they are surplus. But you know Netflix, they always come up with these things.4) I think they missed the opportunity to become most favorable TV series of all times because the reason I've commented above.5) I know they will continue to make more seasons because it is popular and the TV series which was thought to be just 2 season will be ruined with hasty plot. Because in third season, it started to losing good points it had in first and second season.6) Tokyo character is ruining everything and she is irritating.

By the end of episode 2 I knew it was poor at best, but I'll admit to still being mildly intrigued.We've just finished the fourth. It feels like I've dragged myself through at least double that number, with barely sufficient meat to warrant one episode. Its reminiscent of an 80s disaster movie, but with a two hour story being dragged out over 40.Unfortunately my wife is still keen to see it through; I'd prefer to cut my losses right now. If I have to listen to one more clich√©d, tragic character back story (or should I say sob story), I think I'll have to take a quick nap.In the unlikely event it improves, and if I survive until the end, I'll return here to modify my rating.

324,aaysen-11295,Insanely Overrated Soap Opera,5/10,21 June 2020,"Well, I'm shocked to see its high rating here (8.4 at the time of this review). I was advised to watch it as something close to the Prison Break masterpiece. Of course, I did not expect the same level television here but still I expected something... Turned out this was nothing but another Latino soap opera with a huge undeserved hype around it. I dont even know where to start - the ridiculous script that doesnt make sense or even more ridiculous characters with mediocre acting. Clearly not for American audience. This is on the level of Turkish soap operas that are gaining momentum in developing world nowadays. So, if you are into that type of dramas then you might like it. But if you think the script and characters in a show should make sense, dont waste your time.Can't recall when last time I had so much regret about wasting time on a TV show

But about 2 episodes in, you realize it is not for the thinking-crowd. It is basically the film Breakfast Club but instead of being some kids who bond in detention, they are robbers (and some hostages and a cop too) who have bonded and formed lifelong bonds during a bank robbery. Alternating between brutal shootouts with law enforcement and then dance parties with their gang in the bank.You can also describe it as telenovela meets a video game. Emotions, drama, attachments and at the same time ridiculous stunts like the one time Tokyo runs into the entire police force shooting at her and manages to shoot her way out with one gun shooting at them, all the while having an over-the-top badass facial expression of course. A character is only ever hurt or injured in their brutal shootouts as a means to facilitate bonding within the group.

342,thetruth45,Entertaining but not well done,6/10,10 April 2020,"This show is entertaining. However it's not well polished. Reminds me of a college movie project for a film student. Has a very low budget/cheap feel to it. Actors are mostly terrible D level actors, average script, and below average production. However ultimately it was entertaining. So heres my review- acting F, script C, production D, entertainment B+

344,peter-376-761113,"Not perfect, but very entertaining.",9/10,2 November 2018,"Yes - as in almost every story of this sort there are some plot elements that stretch credulity, but it's an entertaining ride.Production values are excellent, the writing is sharp & the acting first rate. Unlike in movies of this genre there is enough time to create relatively rounded characters. Yes, there are some cliched elements, but that is the norm in a highly stylized movie like this - it's not supposed to be ""realistic"". It's certainly unpredictable & original - doesn't really follow expectations & sort of shifts tone a bit as it progresses. It's an odd mix of ""Leon, The Professional"", ""Ocean's Eleven"" ""Inside Man"". (I will say, the Spanish police - trained swat teams, no less - appear to be terribly incompetent marksman! )Seasons 3 & 4 still entertaining, althoughNetflix is definitely stretching things out for the purposes of ... ""papel"". Interesting to see so many negative reviews. People are criticizing it for being ""unrealistic"". Really? How realistic are the Mission Impossible or James Bond movies? How believable are the plots? For that matter, how realistic is ""Breaking Bad"", or ""Ozark"" or ""Peaky Blinders""? How believable are the plots?Overall, ""Casa Del Papel"" is a stylish, & fun heist series with a mix of drama, action, humour & pathos & works pretty well taken as it was intended.Just finished Season 5: still entertaining ... & a little darker. Again, I have to say criticizing it for being ""unrealistic"" - which it certainly is, is besides the point. It's exciting, intriguing, stylish & fun.One other thing: how can people watch foreign language movies dubbed? Dubbing is always a sure way to ruin a movie. My experience with subtitled foreign language moves is that after a while you're barely even aware you're reading the subtitles. Stick with it people!",Money_heist

347,drpunkrock,It looks good,2/10,9 July 2018,The positive first: cinematography and camera work are good and I also liked the soundtrack. The premise is pretty decent as well even though they ripped it off from Inside Man. And that was it. Why do people behave so stupidly when they plan a heist for such a long time? Why does the Professor put people like Berlin in there that are obviously not able to control themselves and stick to the plan? Why does the Spanish detective go on a date with some guy she met in a cafe during a raid that is international news? Why is the bug in the glasses not detected since it transmits to the professor? Why is Angel written like a telenovela character? Why is almost EVERYONE behaving so goddamn stupid in this? Arturito wants the SWAT-team to storm the building so they get rescued??? Everybody would be shot that way. Gunshot wounds heal in 10 hours. Women are generally emotional and irrational and need to show their bodies for no reason. The close calls are sometimes totally unbelievable. The positive reviews cannot be real because this is just a pretty soap with guns.,Money_heist

Stranger things was my original favourite but now after watching this it's definitely the best. The characters are what makes this show amazing, the professor being my favourite with all the tricks he pulls out his pocket are great. This is a very entertaining show, the English version was dubbed over perfectly, I've seen other shows with English voice actors and they haven't been as good as this. And I'm super excited for the new season that has just been announced. 10/10

358,sashairk,A sad example how sequels driven by greed can destroy a great show,5/10,29 September 2020,"I loved the first two seasons of this show: a great cast, smart script, good production. It really could not be better than that and I, usually not so 'generous' with my grading gave them a solid '10'. And then the disaster stroke: obviously the producers of this show, dazzled by the success of the first seasons decided to push for the sequel, with catastrophic results. Well, should they invested more money and hired more talented script writer, given the excellent cast, they might have produce a decent sequel that could even match the first two seasons. Alas, it did not happen. The third season was not so successful carbon copy of the first two seasons, while the rest of the seasons degraded to a pure soap opera. As a result, with a heavy heart I had to downgrade my score from 10 to 5. What a shame!

376,arx00,Great to Garbage 1970s fantasy,4/10,23 February 2019,"First season is really good but as of mid 2 things go out of control. This series is anti government, never have I seen police depicted so incompetant like hello kitties.I do not care about its anarchic leftist message... the intricacies and overall plot is very exciting yet their master argument is insultingly weak. Am I stupid to believe that armed career criminals (studying dutifully for 5 months :-)) are the solution to capitalist system's problems and Spanish police are stupid enough to forget disconnecting electricity? But hey, this is a .... ""masterpiece"" :-)Seriously I wish they could come up with something that's decent at ideological level instead of this floor mat that tries to create a 1970s style militant leftist rebellion at the age of blockchain. (Assuming the series owners are not smart capitalists collecting dumb people's money)And the pregnant mistress who fells in love with a violent thug (as officially depicted in the beginning) and finally turns into a machine gun toting criminal, how come she not turn into a giant spider and attack the city of Madrid :-)))))))This is a shame for Spain and leftist/anarchist ideology but it's facebook generation watching so let's give thumbs up LOL!!!",Money_heist

Whose idea was it to put multiple romances in a 'heist' series?And more importantly, whose idea to turn a mini series into a 4 season soap opera with a season 5 in the works?The show must end, this show has the worst case of seasonal rot I have seen. Only the network behind the show knows what may come next, and how bad it could be.What started as an intelligent intriguing heist story is now just a soap opera.

This show is teen targeted but it doesn¬¥t have to be this childish, full of one dimensional characters, hollywoodian cliches and absolutely predictable.
Great movies came from Spain last two decades, movies that haded new blood and somehow redifined some genres like horror for instance, REC. is a good example , Abre Los Ojos or La Comunidad, even some spanish directors as Amenabar, Almodovar or Alex de la Iglesia are top notch movie makers.
This show break with all the good that was done in recent years in Europe and is just trying to pair with american productions that are way superior like Prison Break.
Three episodes after, three hours of my life that I will not get back, what a let down.

386,bboygringo,Honestly....,9/10,25 April 2020,"I think that the producers should've done the same thing that the ''Breaking Bad'' producers did... instead of making season 4 it would've been better if they had made a movie to final it down, im sure it would've had a much better and satisfying outcome.
La Casa de Papel started pretty well in my opinion, interesting start off, it was fun and accually really hyped, but over time it started to get lame, i was losing interess in it, then i must admit that when it got to the last episode of season 3 when The Proffessor fell in his own trap thinking that Raquel was killed...it got my attention, it was well made, but then season 4 came...and OMG, why didnt they just made a movie to explain an ending to all of it in a short film, just like in Breaking Bad El Camino, sure it would've been kind of a rip off but im sure it would've turned out something way much better and descent and best of all it would have ended right there, Season 4 shouldn't have been made, stupid, boring, plot holes, unsatisfying, Now i dont even know if i should watch Season 5, and i really did not understand what was the huge hype about this season 4 all about.",Money_heist

* action scenes well executed
* soundtracks
* solid plot.THE BAD: I'm gonna go into spoilers

However, they should have better stopped after it because season 3 and 4 just spoiled it all. It was no longer meticulously planned. Season 3 pace is slower than previous two one , however season 4 is more slower than 3. After completion of season 3 I have thought they will show some more convincing plot. But in season 4 one can directly jump to episode 6 eithout missing anything. From 1 to 5 episodes they have only focused on gandia....And dont know why they have given him so much prefference and whats the role for arturo. It was dumb decision. Finally, I can say sea

The relationships between robbers and hostages were plot driven rather than situational or character driven, so lost me. Also, I'd have to go back to the A Team to find so many people that never got hit amidst barrages of automatic weapon firing. Then after they got away with it, none of them changed their appearance and all agreed to go on this new job. Insultingly convenient. Is seen this offering for more than a year but skipped it because the title seemed as stupid as ""Snakes on a plane"". Why they just didn't translate it directly from Spanish is beyond me: ""The House of Paper"" sounds far more intriguing. Perhaps they think english speakers are simpletons?

This is reminding me of Season 2 of Sense8 or the end of S7 of GoT.Here are the spoilers in this episode that made me shut it off; maybe I'll go back to it, maybe I won't:1. The professor getting stuck in the mud. Really? Then leaving an RV full of equipment to be found?2. Arturo running into the bank. These characters would have thrown him right back out again. I had enough of his character in the first two seasons and, in the periphery of this season, he was tolerated. Now he's just going to be intolerable. Again. I have zero interest in that character and a much-reduced interest in continuing the series.3. The bug in Rio's clothes. C'mon... really.? You don't think the robbers would think ""Oh, the police gave you these clothes, sure just keep wearing them and let's discuss all our plans while you're looking so good."" And when they had the wand that Stockholm waved around Arturo you don?t think they'd have done the same to Rio.God, I hate cheap, lazy and sloppy writing.

If Netflix had chopped off so many unnecessary scenes and ended it with S3 and S4 consisting of 13 episodes each , then it would've been so good. Also Netflix shouldn't have released Season 5 in tow volumes. It diluted many portions that would've actually worked out. I would've given a 7.5/10 but for the iconic Dali mask and Professor , it is worth an 8.P S : Netflix shouldn't have greenlit Berlin. It was a mistake and I'm not gonna watch it.

401,auct-eu,Literally the dumbest show,2/10,5 September 2021,"All actions are the most dumb and unrealistic as it can be.First of all thesis we don't rob people is nonsense.They literally rob people by devalueing their money.Every scene in this show is pure nonsense.Even the dumbest police on earth not that dumb.Even if police are bad, this don't make criminals good.

402,kirstenpace-95105,A whole lot of Hype for a whole lot of Nothing,6/10,12 August 2019,"So, I started watching this show, admittedly, because of the hype.. And it just made me come to terms with the fact that just because a show has a lot of hype surrounding it, doesn't mean it's anything special.Case in point : Money Heist is nothing special. I have seen countless films and shows relating to heists, and I admit that this show brings some sort of unique aspect to it here and there, but in reality that also falls flat after the first season. Since the ""heist"" basically repeats itself over multiple seasons.However, to me the most annoying thing about it is the script. I'm sure it sounds way better in Spanish than it does in English, but if you don't understand Spanish, you're stuck with a very simple, uninteresting script. I know I could have watched it with subtitles and in Spanish, but to me, the flow of the series is lost that way. I think the translation could have been much better for viewers who don't speak Spanish. It clearly did not have a lot of effort put into it, to the point where the dialogue sounds limited and almost childish at times.The police have to be the dumbest police ever at this point, they seem to be made a mockery of persistently. The self-proclaimed ""mastermind"" professor doesn't impress me either. None of the characters seem to have much depth or engaging storylines.I think portraying the show to be so special and then being let down when watching it has really made me question what the general public find so ""special"" about it, honestly. I, on the other hand, was left bored.It just seems like a cheap rip-off of Inside Man.",Money_heist

405,MattJackman92,How to destroy a show,7/10,12 May 2020,"Seasons 1 & 2 were great and well worth a watch. I would easily give them a 9/10, they were so fast paced and full of tension, but most of all they were original and fun.Since then, someone at Netflix has unfortunately cashed in and completely destroyed this show. Honestly, it's like watching a completely different programme. It's become a non-sensical, soap opera and how some of the characters are still allowed to make decisions is beyond me. I've written this review after season 3 and will not be watching season 4, I've got a feeling it's for the best!I would absolutely recommend that you watch the first two seasons and forgot that they ever made anymore, it will not affect your enjoyment of the first two. Ruined by its own success, what a shame.

407,francisss,When NETFLIX took over,4/10,9 April 2020,"La Casa De Papel (aka Money Heist) was a masterpiece! Until Netflix took over and created Season 2 (Part III & IV).
Ending of Season 1 (Part I & II) was perfect, leaving audiences a bittersweet ending. But netflix ruined it by making a sequel and adding back stories from its original supposed to be good story. Look what happened to Riverdale - a total mess after the next few seasons. Please STOP...Just STOP making more seasons. I hope Part V would be the last.

A lot of great writing. Ingenious plot and original take on heist. Great perfotmances by solid actors.Now, what ruined it for me is Tokyo. That chica's immaturity is deadly. She's the one who makes rash decisions and lands her teamates in trouble or dead (Moscow). They got away with stealing billions and this stupid cow can't be bothered to lay low? And it's Rio who gets caught! She's like an albatros! And then she has the nerve to insist people help her get Rio back, even though Rio would have been safe if it weren't for her!!! Yes, she's beautiful, but if you have that kind of crazy character in your life, that can not be bothered to wise up and learn from their mistake : you need to cut them loose!",Money_heist

As for paper money itself, it's just paper, issued by the government, and finally flowing to the bank. In order to complete this process, people keep working and make everything with their hands in order to get as much paper as possible. After meeting the needs of their lives, people deposit the remaining paper in the bank, waiting for their surplus labor income to be eroded by more paper money printed (commonly known as inflation). Who ever seriously thought about where the more value we created went? Or what?

414,light-rock,Probably I am echoing anything and everything positive,10/10,31 May 2019,"This is truly marvelously entertainingThere are many basic, stereotypical themes going on, but they are performed so very very well.It should be no spoiler whatsoever, this is about a bank heist.At first glance, you wouldn't think you could make a couple dozen episodes about a single bank heist, each episode totally engrossing.The story-telling here is simple, direct, and yet masterful. There is a different kind of psycho-chick for every guy to ogle, there is a psycho-intellectual for everyone into intrigue, and the over-arching story ... is a guilty pleasure to cheer for.The character development sneaks up on you, ""Should I be cheering for the bad-guys?"", and exactly how good is the average ""good-guy"", you will pause to look yourself in the mirror.As I am watching it, there is voice-over in English from original Spanish. You can tell that this is not exactly matching the required breathing and emphasis of the original talent, but yet it is of very high quality and very quickly you won't notice the discrepancy and come to associate with the familiar over-dub voice acting.Right now I am well in to ""part 2"" or ""season 2"" as we would say, and it is late at night and I can't turn it off.",Money_heist

Now the negatives -No logic in most of the scenarios.Police who?Too many unrealistic relationship between robbers and hostages.Mastermind Professor falling in love with the Chief police may sound like a twist but it's actually stupid and guess what it was not in the plan.Lastly Tokyo.

One of my biggest fears was that the show would lose its Spanish essence and would try to please international audiences, specially the US market. It happened somehow in the first two seasons, in which some characters, police mainly, talked in a very polished way, far from the Spanish real style. But I must say that dialogues in third season appear more real: rude and full of cursing.... just the way we are.

The two intertwining storylines of the robbers inside the mint and the professor dealing with the police, each facing problems, is exhilarating. At the end of an episode you'll often think: are they gonna make it? Did the professor forsee this? Seeing the police's perspective as well was very interesting. An action-packed, well-written storyline, with good acting.
Definitely worth a watch.

429,snkhan-27905,Mixed bag,6/10,26 July 2019,The series starts off really strong but then there is too much drama which drags the story. Major loopholes like a person who is the chief negotiator would not have the time or desire to go out for dates while the hostage situation is still ongoing.The only enjoyable scenes are where the actual heist is happening or the professor is negotiating/explaining his plan.The only way I could finish this was to fast forward thru all the emotional relationship stuff which had no bearing on the story and is a waste of time.,Money_heist

433,theashcritique,The greatest crime of the century,8/10,15 December 2021,"This is a unique story, acted and narrated in a very unique way. We have all been in love and sided with criminals, even when they do wrong things. It is a matter of attraction and belief. This group united with the rule that they don't know one another, so they chose city names for themselves, and the second rule is to not get involved together for the sake of the mission. Even though the professor is making a terrible mistake, throughout the first parts of the show he justifies his actions with such reasonableness that you are going to believe it too, even though in the end, it's a crime to steal. The first part was very popular. Everyone watched it, another GameofThrones excitement and one of the very few TV shows produced by Netflix that was actually a hit, even though they only produced it later.The second part was expected to live up to the hype, so people cracked every detail that wasn't perfect. Surely, they made a huge mistake by splitting the final season, which made people get bored easily and surely tired of waiting and wondering why they did not just end it after the first mission. But in my opinion, I did agree that it was a pointless five episodes. But after watching the final episodes, I was kind of blown away, like i did the last time, by the amazing ending, performance, twist, and, of course, the intelligence that makes you constantly wonder. I think every actor did their part as they should have ,the amount of time they took to finish it was fairly enough. I didn't get bored and didn't feel that the extension wasn't necessary. I believe that creating the second mission was satisfying to me, and it completed the whole idea. The role of AliciaSierra was everything to me, I even loved her more than Raquel as a detective, she is the evil mind of the professor.Every fight, every angle, every shot, even the romantic scenes, had great impact, they didn't stick only to action scenes. They made you live their lives, and the second part with the flashbacks stopped you for a while to take your breath and connect you with the present events.Spoilers
Unpopular opinion is that I believe they couldn't just stop at the first crime and keep living like ghosts forever, there had to be a way for them to live freely with no one at their backs. Without it, you would have always thought what would happen next. They couldn't just live in the shadows forever. But the second part gave us closure and re-made our favorite characters again alive with the story of Berlin and his son, which in my opinion is the most lame thing about the second part, and they just couldn't wrap it up well after they stole the gold, as if they didn't know it was Sergio who stole, they didn't clarify the note, so it just didn't make sense, they could have gone with a better obstacle. The whole idea of the fake gold just blew my mind. I believe even the most-twisted minds wouldn't have guessed it. I loved how they ended Arturo's character; It was the most satisfying scene ever and an appreciation for such acting by Enrique acre. I just loved the second part as much as the first. I think even the fights and camera shots and the directing were even better. Every character had their fair share and the perfect ending was so emotional it made us angry.Highly recommended watch till the end, they always surprise you.. this series is like a good meal that needs time to cook!",Money_heist
434,florinc,Excellent idea in the hands of low grade students,5/10,25 July 2019,"So many wrote before me! There is a story about a door in Money Heist. A story that left me numb for hours. Something so powerful, so deep, so human, so poetic, that I pledged to follow all of it all.But that is most of it. I am frustrated by the fact that such a good idea was trusted in the hands of low grade students in cinema. Good actors do not save it. Nothing makes sense, nothing evolves naturally from the plot or characters, except for stupid acts, unrealistic arms handling, unrealistic fight scenes. It is as if the script is 30% written, 40% taken from Hollywood and the rest is left to fill the gap in order for the action to go on.Elite soldiers that cannot shoot at the target, everyone is driven by ego and hormones. The police is shown made of morons, with one woman exception, etc... Go for the door and stop there.

Now, overall, is just another mediocre show with endless seasons. They should had stopped after 2 seasons.

437,jay-408-122145,Plot crafting like no other,9/10,22 March 2020,"Simply put, this is one of the best crafted crime dramas I've ever seen. The characters and plot share equal importance across all three series and the timeline split, (whilst not exactly original), is perfectly crafted to create backstory as the real-time plot unfolds. Special mention also should go to the voice actors ... We watch this in the UK with English overdub and it's done so well that you actually stop noticing it... (And I say this as someone that gets annoyed when Netflix audio slips out of sync by a fraction!) Top class entertainment... We want more!

439,yasan_parto,Should have stayed as La Casa de Papel!,7/10,31 October 2020,"Starting off as a novel idea, unpretentious in its presentation and writing, La Casa de Papel was a well-thought-out script put to screen with a stellar cast. Seasons 1 and 2 gripped us by the neck, shocked us with twists after twists, made us smile out of joy, cry out of grief, yell out of anger and sigh out of shock. We cheered on an entire crew of thieves as they progressed, we felt for an entire group of hostages as they were kept in captivity, we struggled to pick sides in between and all throughout we ignored the many plot holes and questionable scenes that happened because the characters were just too hard not to love and their struggles too relatable.But the show should have stayed La Casa de Papel. The moment the show became Money Heist, they lost their firm grip on the audience. They went out of their way to appease the major non-Hispanic audience of Netflix and on their way to accomplish this mission, edited the show with frequent unnecessary montage sequences like those of Hollywood heist genre, put English classic hit songs as the soundtrack and the more it tried to please everyone, the more plot holes popped out. It looks good but it's not loyal to its core and it's trying too hard and you sense it. The only thing keeping together the show and the audience after Season 2 was again the cast's heart-warming performance and the major plot twists and character write-offs to keep your attention focused. But even those soulful performances and constant struggles and attempts at betrayal lose their power in a series that has lost a sense of its original direction.There are still many good things to be told about this series and for that and for a great roller coaster ride of emotions this series presents its audience with, I relatively rate this show high. It's original, unique and touching but it should stop repeating itself.",Money_heist
440,intermedx,Too much of a good thing makes it a bad thing,7/10,6 October 2021,"This series should have stopped at the end pf the second season. I loved how the plan was so carefully executed and considered so many different contingencies. But after the initial plan succeeded and everyone lived happily after, the greedy bean counters at Netflix had to take something good and destroy it with incomprehensible plot twists and increasing levels of stupidity on the players that never would have passed the initial scrutiny by the professor.Such a massive disappointment.

I came away feeling as if they never really got to the point, and they just included many little personal dramas designed to string out the series. I also feel that many parts, including the Police responses, lacked credibility. I eventually gave up watching because it seemed to go on forever without coming to a conclusion.

448,talktoashish,Almost amazing,7/10,29 March 2020,"Story starts great and remains fairly suspenseful over first 2 seasons but in last few episodes pace slows down. Only reason this doesn't get 9/10 from me is because story becomes illogical over time. Everybody does dumb things. Robbers get lucky all the time. Hence I have decided to not watch third season onwards.SPOILERS -Hundreds of police cannot shoot one Tokyo on bike. Many scenes have all robbers in one room busy when hostages could have simply opened front door and walked out but didn't. Monica, Angel, and Raquel characters change so much in so brief interactions that they give up their whole life and own sense of righteousness and help robbers. Monica and Raquel have excuse of 5 day love but somehow (even at cost of daughter!) Angel also sides with robbers without trying to understand anything. Professor spent whole life planning heist can falls head over heels in love in 1 day? What was his goal in first day offering charger if he didn't want to be close to Inspector? Why didn't he disengage when he realised his growing love? And robbers get lucky so many times that police actions seems laughable. When hostages escape first time around what stopped them from bombing that door open again? Berlin is able to hold on to tens of police alone. In last escape from hanger scene everyone is wasting time on sentimentality but somehow gets ready and out just a minute before. Professor left Island clue for Raquel even though she was police and somehow was convinced that she would side with him. I could name more but you get the gist ...",Money_heist

The action scenes fail completely, because they're simply unbelievable, like some of the protagonists' actions. And it's very prosy. The 2nd season is really boring, only in the last episode there is some tension again.Bad version of ""Inside Man"", was just annoyed. But Berlin reconciled me in the end.

Particularly those gun fights and how they repeated the same plot twice. Professor charming the pants out of female inspectors twice? Come on! Where is the creativity in that?Pedro Alonso, you carried the show all the way to the end and Berlin character was the best and most fitted to a role of a heist man of action. The charisma he added and also some of the most interesting quotes came out of the hedonistic character Berlin. Bravo Pedro. Salute!

454,jaindikshant,No words,7/10,3 June 2020,"Great,loving,best....no words.
I really into this series but i am giving 9 instead of 10 because of season 1 is not quite good as 2,3,4.
But its great one. You really have to see this. And my best part is the character ""PROFESSOR"" woah!!!
And my worst part is the ""ARTURITO"".üòÇ
And my intentions is not to criticize any character. Sorry for that.

466,bilalhussain-46904,Truly awful storytelling!,2/10,6 April 2020,"Season 04 is absolutely and utterly dismal, disappointing and dreadful. Nothing significant happens throughout the season, except the usual shenanigans. I chose to ignore all the flaws but this season has wore my patience thin.I would like to say the show has always been predictable. Over the years, writers have made horrendous choices.
Professor falling in love with the inspector.Professor adding Tokyo to the team, when she can ruin the plan anytime.Killing Berlin and subjecting us to those horrible flashbacksBringing Arturo back into the mix so he can basically be annoying and serve no other purpose.Killing Nairobi, brace yourselves for more flash-backs in season 05.These are just some of the main plot points and does not thousands of cliches and repetitive dialogues and actions of the same characters. The actions don't make sense and it is not as a viewer. It is clearly written for moments rather than logic or common sense. This could just have been about a heist, instead the writers over-complicated everything and dragged into the realms of a drama.This season was clearly a filler with lots and lots of pointless scenes and was a bold move ending it on cliffhanger when everyone already knows Professor is going to live and the plan will succeed except for few hurdles here and there. Netflix has produced a lot of great shows and this is not one of them.",Money_heist

487,TooDrunkToWalk,A work of genious,9/10,5 February 2018,"WARNING - SOME MINOR SPOILER, BUT NO MAJOR SPOILERS. NOTHING THAT WILL RUIN YOUR EXPERIENCE OF WATCHING THE SHOWI just finished watching the show. I am truly struggling to find the words that do full justice to the show.I am afraid one cannot go into this review without going into some basic details of the plot. So a person collects together a group of robbers and they aim to rob whatever is the place in Spain where money is printed.Naturally there is a plan in place where they have worked out all the outcomes and issues that could potentially arise and how to deal with them. Then the game begins. For it is a game, cops and robbers.This may seem similar to a lot of shows and films that have been done. However for what it is worth, it is far superior to any of those shows. For a start the story has so much depth that its hard to believe they fit all that in, in just 15 episodes.Every robber has a unique character and its own character development arc, each with its own twists and turns. Then there are the hostages and a lot of them have their own story arcs and how it affects the outcome of the hostage situation.Lastly there is the story arc of some of the policemen involved. How having to deal with the hostage situation takes a toll on them. The no. of little stories that this show covers is insane. Each of these little stories eventually leading to the climax.Then there is near top of the stuff acting from nearly everyone, especially the lead actor who I won't name here, because in so many actors why give away who the lead was in the review. Just watch for yourself.Naturally like with every show there were bits that I enjoyed more and some bits that I felt could have been better. However I don't want to go into those because they would be major spoiler territory. Suffice it to say that the list of whatever bits I didn't enjoy, is a very short one.I feel I must give this warning not to go in expecting a big gimmicky robbery story with a 'twist' ending. I will even say outright that there is no big twist ending or a big surprise reveal or anything of that sort.The show doesn't cheat you. Like for instance some shows just hide a whole side of the story or give away bits selectively so as to manipulate the viewers and set up a twist finish trying to seem clever that way. This show lays its cards out fully before you and you know exactly who is who and who is doing what.That is where the fun lies, you as the viewers know the full picture and then you see how different characters react in a tough situation, which will either help the guys you were rooting or disrupt their plans. Then you watch those whose plans were disrupted struggle with the situation they find themselves in.This show is more a drama then a typical con or heist film. So shed whatever stereotypes you have about such films or shows when you watch. The show will not disappoint.",Money_heist
488,andrbdeea,You can't stop binge-watching this!,10/10,13 March 2018,"This is addictive to the point that you don't understand how you've watched it all at once.It's unpredictable, it's suspenseful, it's twisted, it's AMAZING!Why it has so many mixed reviews here I really don't get it. Probably because of some inaccuracies with the plot.I for one sometimes need a show that gives me those extreme emotions. This was one of them, I enjoyed it a lot.

489,Arweljos,Dont watch it with english dubbing,8/10,22 May 2018,"8 episodes in and I regret starting, it had a good initial plotline thats let down by really awful dubbing with very poor voice actors which makes it much harder to engage with and get into and is not very gripping, might have been better with the original spanish audio and subtitles, dont understand how there are so many rave reviews for this, it is certainly not deserving of the 8.7 imdb score, its not in the same league as many other programs with lower scoresN.B, I have edited my score, as I continued watching the rest of the show with subtitles, and it made such a difference it was much more engaging, and I really enjoyed it, great story

490,ttiagoribeiro,A masterpiece of action and flawed characters,9/10,9 March 2020,"24 hours series has nothing on this one. This is other level storytelling on a format of a series. Superbly well written, masterfully directed and produced with complex characters and a narrative full of hooks that never let go, they always know how to grab you to keep seeing all unfold.
This is what good American action series and even movies wish and dream they could be!!! Not many now a days can compete with Money Heist.
In matters of action and character it's in its own league. This series will be forever remembered cause nothing made in America can match in quality this masterpiece!! I really believe it is one in all the factors stated above.

498,Danuvius01,"Great crime story, would be better without ideology",6/10,27 June 2020,"It is one of the best crime/robbery stories I have ever seen. It is thrilling, many times unexpected and also with great humor. Acting is great, except for the leading actress playing Tokio. She is an annoying character and also a terrible actress. But the biggest mistake was adding an ideology. Nobody in their right mind would consider them Robin Hood. They are stealing, doesn't matter if they print the money or not. They are threatening people, even if they intend to save everybody. They are not against anyting, the ideology of being the same as central banks print money is totall BS. So the story is great, the only thing should have been left out is the ideology. The creators also made one more huge mistake. Not closing the show after 2 seasons. I believe Sopranos is the greatest show ever and one of the reason for that was closing it on the top. Money Heist first 2 seasons is a full and complete story. They made the same mistake as the creators of Prison Break. It should have been closed.",Money_heist

509,puneetruparel,An intelligent show!,9/10,8 May 2020,"After speaking with my family on Friday night, I switched the TV on nearly around 1 am knowing very well that I would not be sleeping until the next morning at 9 and that's exactly what happened. Why? Two words - Money Heist.Money Heist is a Spanish television series revolving around a heist that is surgically designed by the lead character named 'The Professor' (√Ålvaro Morte). The professor recruits 8 individuals with unique abilities to help him carry out the heist. Drawing parallel to Tarantino's Reservoir Dog in which the robbers were given color-coded names, the professor gives city-based code names to his team. The professor goes on to train the recruits in every imaginable way possible i.e. from handling a gun to handling a surgical scalpel (in case someone gets shot).Morte brings a different finesse to his character that is previously unseen in any of the roles he has portrayed. It is a testimony to the brilliant character development done by √Ålex Pina and Morte's ability to enact it on screen. Morte isn't the only protagonist in this series. The series is narrated from the point of view of Tokyo (√örsula Corber√≥) who plays one of the recruits hired by the Professor. Corber√≥ plays an eccentric and fierce character who acts on impulse and often runs into trouble while the heist is on. As the story unfolds, the storylines behind various characters are revealed and by the end, the audience starts to root and empathize with the Professor and his entourage. Since almost all the characters are fresh faces to the audiences in the US, it is marveling to see the chemistry between them.With complex characters, non-linear storylining, Manel Santisteban's brilliant music, and intelligent cliffhangers spread through the series, 'Money Heist' is the first non-English show that has gone to become the most-watched series on Netflix. So much so that just after airing on Netflix in mid-2017, Netflix acquired the global rights for the show which meant that seasons 3 & 4 were shot exclusively for Netflix. Released during the 'shelter-in-place' period in the COVID-19 times, Money Heist is a highly recommended international drama that is a must-watch.Another interesting fact about Money Heist is it was one of the many shows that Netflix bought without intending to put any marketing dollar behind it. It was the sheer brilliance of the show that people began talking about it, sharing it with their friends and family and the rest is history.Watching this international series reminded me of a quote from our beloved director Joon-Hu Bong's speech, ""Once you overcome the one-inch tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films.""",Money_heist

512,hyacinthypw,Interesting begin but boring by this season,6/10,16 April 2020,"When this episode start in netflix, no matter story, art style, all is Bold innovation. Every episode Will look forward to see the next episode.But when this season came out, give me a same format like season 2.

513,LuciferNebulae,Extremely overrated,2/10,22 April 2020,"I heard so much good about this series. Finally after years of recommendations from different people I decided to give it a try. And boy, what a mistake it was.Let me just say, that I created account here - only to write this review. I am that angry.Let me start with the good things. First season started quite well as the basic premise is very good and intriguing - execute perfect plan and ""steal"" huge sum of money - but how they are going to do that? Character of the Professor was good as well. That is it. No really, that is is.Let's go into the negatives. Almost every character besides Professor is annoying as hell. And it has nothing to do about them being ambiguous. They are just totally unlikable despite clear tries from the series creators. And I guess Tokio takes the prize in that department. Each time I saw her I wanted to skip this part of episode (which I did very often in Season 2), unfortunately she is our narrator... Serbs, Moscow and Berlin were not terrible as characters. The rest is just a joke.After first season I contemplated whether I should continue. I decided to finish story and went into season 2. Who the hell wrote it? Again characters continue their completely stupid behavior - they go from one extreme to another in a span of one episode... , incredible situations happen, stupidity of decisions. Of course I did not expect this series to be accurate and true to life, but there are limits. In season 2 I was skipping entire sections out of boredom, anger and disbelieve - I just wanted it to see how it ends, and forget about it.I will not watch season 3, 4 and 5. Enough of this torture.This is just a poorly executed SOAP opera disguised as heist series, with terrible characters, totally unbelievable situations. What a waste of time. I still wonder how this is so highly rated.",Money_heist
514,ylshu-80647,La Casa de Papel,9/10,30 May 2020,"I like it very much, and I can grasp the rhythm of the last section very well. Love Berlin and Moscow. People are not machines. No matter how well planned they are, they can't escape from feelings. Feelings are the biggest variable here. If you want to find loopholes and imprecise places, you can find as many as you want, but it doesn't matter to me. The whole play has a good grasp of rhythm, a good characterization, and each character's characteristics are in place. The whole play is to attract people and then look down.

516,actuallygenia,"GREAT, BUT OVERHYPED/OVERRATED",7/10,18 June 2020,"I actually like this show, but lately, it became overhype. It should've ended in season 2. Coz season 3 and 4 doesn't make sense anymore. I mean, there's no point of robbing The Bank of Spain whilst being rich isn't the main purpose of the heist.If you're looking for a show that gives you tense and thrilling vibes, this probably is for you. In the very first episode, I bet you might say ""wow this show is hella good and addicting"" but that's just it. I don't feel like I have an emotional bond to the characters, especially when Nairobi, Moskow, Oslo, and Berlin died. It was sad. And I felt bad for them. They deserve better but yeah sometimes, like it or not, you have to kill particular character to make the show more dramatic. Those scenes where four of them is dying are supposed to be sad but I just can't. The thing is, as I have mentioned before, I'm not connected to the characters emotionally. For some people, maybe yes, but me? nopee.Fun fact : this show used to be my favorite show, but after I watch Breaking Bad, this show is no even longer on my top 3 favorite show. The more it goes on, the more it doesn't make sense. Yet, still gonna watch the 5th season though!",Money_heist
517,vanleong-86734,"Very good in Part 1, but became a mess in Part 2",5/10,25 December 2021,"Part 1 of the series was amazing. The story twisted and turned so unexpectedly that I gave the writers lots of credits. The robbers seemed to have the upper hand very steps of the way. Each of the robbers has his/her interesting characters and I like them all.But the story took a dramatic turn toward weirdness in Part 2. Maybe the writers ran out of good ideas and the bad ones started to come out.**** Spoiler Alert *****I was never a fan of Raquel but I do understand people get manipulated emotional, especially someone as good as The Professor. But for someone at her level, leading the crisis management team would do something so reckless to kidnapped The Professor. Why? Because you slept with him? Then, got overpowered (surprised) and eventually turned to the robbers' side. WTF. Then, go back and lied to his colleagues on the police side. WTF*2? With all that, they just let her walk away.Some people has the stereotype (and I don't buy it) that ""women are too emotional to make the tough things"". Well this story fed directly into that wrong stereotype. If that is who she is, she should have and could have never gotten to her position. Something doesn't add up.Now, back to the heist plan. If The Professor has it all figured out, was flirting with the inspector part of the plan? What if the inspector was a guy? What if the inspector wasn't desperate for love? Would everything fall apart then?I give up and not continuing to Part 3.",Money_heist

528,t-09747,A typical Spanish drama,4/10,6 December 2021,"Having watched the first season, I would rather stop. If people say that the first season is the best, so what's there next? Sorry, but the first season was not good at all, too. Why such a high rating? The initial idea was good but the actual realization... hmmm. The lack of acting and scripting skills introduce the need for the constant background voice that explains what's going on and what are the motives of the characters. All in all, it is a ususal Spanish film-making aproach: the series are packed with story twists and absurd coincidences. Nobody tries to act or cares if it looks at least a little bit real.

Police forces having their tactics that cought robbers of guard and they suffered loss and consequences. Unexpected releationships, hostages escape plans. It was lalal very New and unique to me and i watched it in 2 days. Then season 2 started which was slightly weaker then the first one. I Just started loosing interest more and more. Until the part where they finally escape, Season 2 episodes 6.it was a different show. Raquel turning sides and helping robbers gets out without consequences to finally meet her love again in a most cliche moment in a ""phone charger"" scene. Trained professionals feeling like a little kids with water Guns Just hiding behind shields, Without any tactic. Same cops not shooting robbers while lasers are clearly on them. Them shooting wall in a 1.5m height while robbers are crawling. Whole Scene with Tokio's and Rio's shootout with a cops is disaster. Like cops were told to not kill anyone at all cost. Tokio sliding and shooting better then 3 cops standing still behind covers made me sick. Even secretary uses a gun like she was borned with it in hands.I like seeing characters progression in tv shows but here they dont progress, they flip personalitiesThe more i watched the more i was against main characters.

Great plot; many twists and turns. Really kept me involved. Something I haven't seen before. But....wow!!! Are they serious with this sexist, misogynistic dialogue?!? Some of the lines were straight out of a bad 1990's corporate sexual harassment training video. I didn't bail b/c the lines were few and far between. But they were so shockingly out of place in 2017/2018 that I was constantly taken aback. Really offensive and just...stupid, disheartening, unnecessary, and chauvinistic. Perhaps it was the English dubbing translations, but no matter the reason the gross sexist lines made otherwise riveting moments laughable and almost unbearable. I enjoyed it enough to keep with it though. When the misogyny was on display my husband and I just groaned and shook our heads. Wouldn't do that if someone said that IRL but nothing much we could do about this other than write this review to express our shock, dismay, and amazement that this made it to Netflix with these insulting lines.",Money_heist

The scriptwriters of this show exibits all of these attributes of an average Mediterranean. Obviously they have worked on the first two episodes in depth, and went on to sip their Sangrias. The public interest the show has received must have been a huge shock and they were obviously totally unplanned, since I can find no other explanation for the shameful comedy show that it evolves afterwards.The perfect plan for robbery that the show is based on quickly evolves into a series of random acts, mainly based on continuous overhearing of some dialogues by others (Very typical in Mediterranean - Latin American shows) and our bunch of stupid robbers can not manage to keep their sexual desires under control for a couple of days. I could not count how many times there were effectively ZERO robbers guarding the captives, while they were having a meeting, fighting with each other or having sex somewhere. And the ultimate point, Tokyo's return to the Mint... words are not enough to describe the level of stupidity of that scene.As I mentioned at the title, after a point I could not stop laughing while watching.

The robbers seem like they had a week to know each other and prepare for the robbery, coz the tensions and unprofessional conduct doesnt feel like they had months to prepare like they want us to believe.
The show wants us to believe the lead negotiator is the best there is, but so far, it feels like she is not as good as advertised. She made one mistake so far and she has a nervous breakdown, and what does she do, she calls her mum and tells her everything. Doesn't seem so professional, and comes off as an amateur or like its her first time doing this.
The characters are all very sloppy, making stupid mistakes just to stretch out the story. Its just lazy writing in my opinion, though it appeals to a certain audience i know.

540,sandeeplaxman-89728,One of the best tv shows I watched,9/10,24 May 2020,"Not sure why there is lot of negative reviews out there for season 3 and 4 but let me tell you this show is one brilliant show. Agree season 3 and 4 are not as great as season 1 and 2 but there is more action and drama. The only thing I missed is the Berlin character in the center stage. Every actor has put their best effort in this show and it makes us fall in love with them. If you have watched Breaking bad then you will like this show for its thrilling roller coaster ride from start to finish. Waiting for season 5.

The story drags, and gets boring. There are too many stupid decisions, by all parties, both thieves and police. A simple example: one of the thieves examines closely, for a long time, a 100-euro bill using a magnifying glass. Why? They are using the National Mint to print those bills. Why does she have to examine it? To make sure it is not ... counterfeit??? And on top of that, this happens while one of the thieves is gravely injured and they are supposed to be in a great hurry! This is one of the many examples of stupid actions in the script, and unfortunately there are too many of those.",Money_heist

Their actions are so unjustified.
I'm just giving it a 6/10 because of the suspense, which I had to ignore all the nonsense there was in the show in order to enjoy.

If not, you'll find yourself frustrated at the OBVIOUS poor choices the characters make. Aside from this, you'll cringe at the mild yet weird sexism, and you'll say ""wtf?"" at all the melodrama -- misplaced in a show that is supposedly about a bank robbery.The characters are undercooked and the whole story is contrived. I'm midway through season or part one, and I can't help but feel I've been bamboozled by the hype into watching this dreck. I'll get through the first season, but it has to end with a big finish that makes everything else I watched make sense. Right now I'm not that hopeful about season two.

But then, it turned into the most telenovela level soap opera stew ever. The police is super stupid. They leave someone who is being interrogated alone with the face recognition computer. The drunk lover cant reach the main inspector because her voicemail is full, and she doesn't even listen to her voicemails completely afterwards. Mother suddenly has super full-blown Alzheimer and doesn't even remember that the professor has just slapped him, which never happens in real Alzheimer patients. Also, she asks her daughter whether she had made love.... in front of the guy who she has had sex with! Head robber sleeps with head police, the head police doesn't even seem to be working on a case this important, and is more worried about her love life. Robber sleeps with the secretary and suddenly decides to keep her baby just because the robber says, also forgets that he is holding her hostage and has shot her in the leg. Professor says: We aren't stealing anything! We are printing our own money! Honey have you ever heard about a concept called INFLATION? And he is supposed to be the smart one!

Plotholes everywhere, most of the characters actions don't make sense, stupid new characters, totally unrealistic crap happening all the time, the professor seems to know everything, his pakistani hackers are straight out of a bad hollywood hacker movie, the dialogue makes you go mad because its so stupid and there are way too many throwbacks.
Also, the whole thing is way too long and just gets boring, this could easily be a 3 hours long movie.Another thing that's just ridiculously stupid is Julia or Juanito, the new undercover hostage. First of all, who needed a trans person in this series? it doesn't even contribute to the plot, Netflix just put her in because of money and good reputation. Then secondly, the ""trans person"" Julia isn't even played by a real trans woman. ridiculous!Take my advice and watch Seasons 1 and 2, leave the rest out.",Money_heist

I think Nairobi had some much more to her character and it was painful to see her fall.But worst part was the script for professor, what happened to all his big smart plans? He just lost all his brain capacity just like that. Only good plan he had this season was the ""Pris plan"" but I wasn't satisfied with that. Why take her in their and what is there plan.
This whole season contained almost nothing about the actual heist, just about freeing Lisabon and a man that immune to bullets.I think they did a season that was almost unnecessary, with only fillers in all the characters script. Was it just me that didn't feel like I was watching ""Money heist""?Worst part was how they left us with a cliffhanger and how did she even get there with just a license plate.

569,arunsrid,Over rated and over hyped nonsense,3/10,9 May 2020,"First of all, I like spanish movies, heist based dramas, and themes based on people's revolution or resistance against the government, e.t.c, as long as the creators treat the audience's sensibilities with some level of respect and intelligence. That is not the case with La Casa de Papel. And for all the people who weirdly think that Season 1 and 2 were brilliant but only Season 3 and 4 ruined the show, let me tell you one thing - all 4 seasons were as dumb as anything I've ever seen.
Here is what we have - Robbers on a heist printing their own money in the bank, Robbers stealing the national gold reserves from the bank, Public loves the robbers and consider them heroes (oh boy !!), Robbers fall in love with hostages, hostages make love to robbers, robbers make love to robbers, Hostages become robbers, Chief of police investigating the case falls for the robbers leader's charms and decides to run away with him, becoming a fugitive herself (boy oh boy !!), Police teams with an IQ of a high school student are made to handle the case in all 4 seasons, and every battle won by the robbers against the dumb police is portrayed as a ""larger than life, world-class"" victory. I got sick and tired with the nonsense after Season 1 and through half of Season 2, and the only reason I kept watching Season 3 and 4 was to see whether there might be any tiny iota of intelligence and maturity from the police team (which would've calmed my nerves a bit !!), but sadly NO. I gave a 3 star rating only for Najwa Nimri (although her presence was only in few episodes of Season 3 and 4). If not for her, I would've rated a 1 star.
Spare yourself from this nonsensical money heist show which insults the audience's sensibilities. If you really want to watch action and adrenaline, which is atleast sensible and realistic, and treats the audience as someone with above average IQ levels, watch the series ""Fauda"" en Netflix, which is the story of undercover agents in Israel and Palestine, depicting the conflicts and on-going crisis between Israel and Palestine.",Money_heist
570,albundyz,good but plot has progressive holes,8/10,13 January 2022,"Good, I would recommend. Whenever I see movies/series like this, I want to be entertained. When something illogical happens, I often overlook it cuz the story is so entertaining. When the 2nd illogical thing happens, I still enjoy the story, but become a bit skeptical. Season 1 was great, but the accumulation of illogical things put a real damper on season 2.If you were a woman and put in charge of handling a NATIONAL EMERGENCY, would you take time out to find a boyfriend?If you had meticulously planned a robbery for a LONG time (min 5 months, but probably a year) would you look for romance in the middle of the heist?If you (#1 investigator) discover the mastermind of the robbery, would you walk into his warehouse alone? Or would you call for backup?Also, you stressed to your gang to have no personal relationships, yet 2 of the robbers are involved with hostages? And 2 other robbers have fallen in love AND you, the Professor, decided to get romantically involved with the #1 investigator? Wowall criticisms aside, enjoyed the show, but I can't give it a 10.",Money_heist

A splendid story executed with superb craftmanship,1/10,28 March 2021,"This was created and carefully planned with precision and dedication, skills and love for the profession, executed with superb craftmanship. I do not mean the heist, a well planned coup by itself, I mean the series. 4 seasons, don't bother about seasons 3 & 4, they are just silly follow ups. Still a clear tenner, if not... Yes, regrettably, if not. This is not how women should be portrayed and left behind at the glorious end. Watch and judge for yourself. Now a one star series, one star for excellent cinematic craftmanship.

576,lpirc,"Another spanish soap opera, this time combined with an exciting bank robery",7/10,7 October 2019,"Let me start with saying, that even though it has multiple flaws, I am happy that I watched this series.
The story starts perfectly. It presents an extraordinary bank robbery plan, and it gives you action already in first episode. From there, almost every episode ends with a cliff hanger, so they keep your attention untill the very end. But as the story progress, it starts getting more and more flaws.
Maybe a bit typical for spanish series, there are 4 love stories progressing parallel with the main story. So the biggest story flaw in my opinion is, that each of those 4 robbers are ready to compromise the 1 bilion euros heist, for the purpose of love. How sweet, just like the real life, isn't it?
The second flaw is that all the action scenes are like some 80s action movie, where the main characters can't get shot. Well yes they can, but not in the shootout itself. There are bullets flying everywhere, but only narrowly missing them. Only later, when the drama music starts and when there is only one bullet left, that's the one that is going to hit one of them. Don't count this as a spoiler, when you'll hear that musuic accompanied with slow motion, you'll already know what to expect.
Then lets move to the main character, Tokyo. As I see in multiple reviews, I'm not the only one who founds her anoying. She is a rebel type emo girl, perhaps an idol for teenage girls, but up to an age of 15. Her acting is lacking of any facial expressions and her voice, which sadly is narrating the whole story is disturbingly anoying aswell.",Money_heist

578,nicolasarnhold,Laughable,1/10,5 December 2019,"There are a few options why this garbage of a series is rated this high (low/no standards, kids as audience, bought reviews) - and I'm not saying that ratings are indicative of the production's quality, however ""quality"" may be defined.In short: this series is laughably bad. Why? The whole acting, story etc. is so ridiculous I wondered a few times if Spanish audiences have a totally different movie language than other Western countries.For example, there is this bunch of school kids visiting the place to be robbed by a group of gangsters. A girl and a boy from that class exchange a few initial whatsapp messages and within minutes they hold hands and seconds later they kiss! Another few minutes and they make out on the toilet!! wtf???
Same thing with a guy and a woman from the gangster group. They look at each other during their first briefing, seated like a bunch of school kids with the ""professor"" in the front. Later that day, the guy appears at the room of the chick, she initially sends him away to only literally crash with him into the bed. And that's just the way sexual nonsense in the first episode.It goes on and on with cringe worthy dialogues and plots. The reason why the first of the robber's gets identified is because that guy left one of the school girls (then hostage) take a video to send it to her family. He leaves her with the phone in front of her to argue with a female robber (the one he hopped into the bed with), of course that chick uses the phone anyways - and of course she doesn't hide it because heavily armed criminals can't be dangerous.

580,eydryan,A well made show which goes nowhere,7/10,24 January 2019,"I have to preface this by saying that I have been quite impressed by the first few episodes of this show, so much so that I didn't mind the foreign language or the weird acting by some of the cast. It's certainly worth a watch, and the premise is very interesting.However, the action is at times less believable and the pacing is really all over the place. Add to that the flat characters that never react to anything and the plot which just seems to float from episode to episode on the writers' whim, and you get something with a lot of potential but poor execution.Without going into too much detail, it is probably obvious to everyone that this is about a plan which doesn't work out entirely as intended, or they wouldn't have multiple seasons of it. As such, sometimes the ways the plan moves along or doesn't are very out exaggerated and unlikely, and it really bothers me as a viewer for some master criminals to be this incompetent at times. The ending of the first season especially, makes things feel like the work of street corner amateurs rather than true professionals, and there is no plan A, let alone B or C. And the way some problems with the plan get resolved makes us ask the question: why wasn't that just part of the plan from the beginning!The pacing as well is very inconsistent, with episodes which are full of action followed by episodes full of minor character drama and flashbacks which really don't go anywhere.Another criticism I want to leverage is that the characters are very one-dimensional, and even their main traits sometimes don't even matter as they become cardboard cutouts of people. The most present hostage, for example, goes through immense emotional states but none of them seem to change him in any way. The same goes for the robbers, they never change, they are never really affected, they just keep being at times a badass and at times absolute amateurs.Finally, I feel the biggest problem is that the plot itself is in such stark contrast to the premise of the show. I get that they wanted to create intrigue and conflict to move the story forward and stretch it out to many seasons, but you can't have the greatest plan in the world be constantly foiled by crappy plot points and cartoony drama.",Money_heist
581,rjd-91328,Which just can't you stop...,7/10,28 July 2018,"... When the climax is reached? The show starts as a masterpiece. I am still binge watching and almost done with season 2.
The show would be a perfect one season show. I would have given a 9 - they don't deserve 10 because of the plot holes. But season 2 is just too much. It doesn't get boring, but it just takes too long to end the story.

The crooks spent 5 months to prep for the heist, going through every single detail. From wearing the same uniform and masks to hide their true identity. Yet, they can't find the time to buy a pair of gloves! Of course, leave traces of your prints all over the mint!Also, their MO is very similar to that of the movie Inside Man. So for me that have watch Dalton Russell's work, find their move rather predictable. If you have watch Spike Lee's brilliant heist movie, then you can guess what is to come next with this show.Most of the characters are annoying with almost no character development. Some were played to be integral to the storyline but then later just left on the sidelines, ending up like a featured extra.The title Money Heist throws people off. I stopped after Season 2 because it became a love story more than an actual robbery. The robbers and hostages had time to fall in love as these sub plots is seriously ridiculous. I had to drag my feet to finish Season 1. The only reason I finish S2 is after reading the reviews here where some reviewers said to watch only up to S2.

599,Midget_1414,S1 and S2 were really good but the 2nd heist meh,4/10,13 January 2022,"S1 and 2 were on one bank heist which had a solid plot and the action was good. Season 3+ on the other hand was bad, we had these useless 5 minutes combat scenes where not a single person could land a shot, they were just shooting in walls and whatever. How the hell did Gandia even escape after executing Nairobi. Then you have the inaccuracies where they said clip every time instead of a magazine. The grenade scenes were ridiculous, the explosion was way too big and the RPG scene was also bad they shot right next to them and they all kept shooting the second after like nothing had happened. Also, a lot of them didn't even know how to hold a gun properly. Also, you have the cringy parts like the "" special forces "" that put on face paint to enter a building, is it supposed to make you blend in or something? They can't even aim and they just scream for no reason at all while shooting. Sure an average grunt might scream like a maniac but highly trained special forces aren't screaming around like morons for no reason. Honestly, I enjoyed the show at first but I'm glad they finally ended the show because the last 3 seasons were terrible. What was that pregnancy scene, was it really necessary like wtf.",Money_heist

602,global_dan,Proof the Spanish can also do bad American TV,1/10,7 April 2018,"Netflix's recommendation algorithms clearly need some work if they think this was a 98% match. The initial premise is interesting but became an interminable endless series of: - ever widening plot holes and layers of implausibility - some of which have been mentioned in other reviews. Will I recover from a gunshot wound as quickly as some of the characters here? Where do all the pizzas and food come from? Is the Mint cafeteria still operating during the heist? Why is the lead investigator running around doing her own thing while the whole world's media watches the siege?
 - the repeated use of the Long Arm of Coincidence to move the plot along
 - levels of incompetence among the lead investigator, Spanish police and intelligence services which make the Keystone Cops look like a highly trained SWAT team
 - cut-out characters whom it is impossible identify with, let alone like.I hate-watched to the end to drink a shot of vodka each time another plot hole or implausibility came up, but ran out of alcohol long before this unnecessarily long series came to an end.

605,Prophet89,Could have been so much more,6/10,15 September 2019,"Just finished the second season, which marks the end of the main story. In short - I feel a bit exhausted. Why? Because of the script. Overall there is great production value, the dialogues are well written, the characters are believable. But the story itself is not THAT original (Inside Man, anybody?) and on top of that, the whole story suffers greatly from the main and constantly overused plot device, or rather, a plot-cheat. It is something that's also predominantly present in another known and praised TV show - The Walking Dead. Can you guess? Yes, it's the characters' incompetence, borderline idiotic decisions and also the unbelievable coincidences or plain nonsense that are commonly incorporated into the narrative. For a keen eyed, intelligent and inquisitive viewer this feels like material for a good story riddled with a barrage of frustrating twists and turns. It is what is best described as lazy writing. Let me give you an example ""everything is going very well for our characters, then suddenly SOMETHING and one of them needs to go out of ""the plan"" to correct it. He has time and means to go prepared, he is a criminal mastermind and then we see him do some very incriminating activity without gloves. Aaaand this way we are soon in a whole lot bigger trouble. Which I accept, but we really could get there in some more sophisticated way. I really can't count the times I yelled at the screen wanting those supposedly hardened criminals to just grow a pair and get together. Not to mention the obvious nonsensical plot holes - like in one episode we learn that spanish policia has a protocol to close down the entire city in search of terrorists - which they enact to catch a single suspect, but when a group of criminals with a lot of money is getting away (just by a thread, of course) the police just stands there.Just started the third season and I see that there is no change for the better. Magically the satellite phones can be traced geographically (they can't actually, all you can know from the other side is which satellite the called is connected to, which gives you pretty much a quarter of the globe area). But if that was the case in the story, then we would have to make up some actually intelligent way for authorities to find our fugutives.All in all, there's plenty good here, but it's not like it's something that's never been done before. Except the language, it reeks of hollywood writing and directing style and not in a good way.6/10.",Money_heist
606,jozii89,With the Season 5 conclusion - best show ever!,10/10,17 December 2021,"I loved Money Heist when it first came out. Season 1 was fresh and exciting, season 2 saw a solid and very satisfying conclusion to the first heist. Brilliant stuff!I was sceptical toward season 3. How could they continue and trump what they had already done? I quickly realized that they were on to something, and throughly enjoyed where the show was going.Then half of season 3 and 4 let me down somewhat. Things became too drawn out. They're still good seasons - no part of Money Heist is ""bad"" - just a little too much of the same thing, and I wasn't a fan of all the flashbacks.My spirits were lifted again with the end of season 4, which ended the heist on a cliffhanger. I went into season 5 feeling excited again!And boy did season 5 deliver! I'd say it's the best season of them all, and now, looking back at the bigger picture of the show, Money Heist is one of the best shows ever!All those flashbacks I previously didn't like now make perfect sense. Everything is tied together, and there's a grander scope to the whole show that was never a thing in the first seasons. The show has been lifted from a cool idea with exciting characters and plot, to an epic like Game of Thrones.Unlike Game of Thrones, however, Money Heist gives itself proper time to reach its awesome (and immensely satisfying) conclusion. In hindsight, those ""filler episodes"" I didn't like in season 3 and 4 are a must. Game of Thrones could have used a few more seasons to reach the exact same conclusion it already did. Money Heist didn't make the same mistake by rushing it, but rather gave itself the proper space to build up to the satisfying conclusion. Now I'm super thankful for that.All this said, the show is not without its flaws. There are character choices I still question or don't understand. Perhaps I need to rewatch it at some point to find details I missed, and to view the seemingly random flashbacks in a different light.Though in all honesty, I likely never will. Because the beauty of this show is in the unknown, the excitement of where things will go next, the twists and turns and the big question - which is not IF they will make it, but rather HOW they will do so.I feel like I've watched an epic movie over the course of several years. Other shows should take note. It's rare to see such a well-calculated and coordinated conclusion and a show that feels like it had a plan all along, one it didn't tell the audience about but rather trusted us to see things through to the end. And those of us who did were rewarded.I think this is my only 10 on IMDB.",Money_heist
607,shiversad,This is what happens when you run out of ideas.,6/10,6 December 2021,"Quick info: I completed all 5 seasons and my rating which is 6 is just for the first 2 seasons, rest is 4 or 3.5, so when this series aired it was quite intriguing and new as it had fresh plot and good actors to cover for it and it
came from not netflix as mind you first two season was produced by another studio and it aired on spanish network and after that it was over, so netflix decided to rake in cash as it went very popular when they bought its right so they thought to make more seasons but sadly decision to make something will not match the stories kept in front of us, so thing happened is for season 3-5 they kept on running in circles as the stakes were big as budget was big but it went completely dumb and illogical on every part of its way for example ""if they were planing for this since the beginning then why go with the mint heist first"" and it same story in every season after 3 as they made same mistakes again and again and they kept messing it up with bs drama and romance which is downright cringey at point"" and they gave tokyo a back story which is so dumb that it will kill your braincells when you think why she was doing all this stuff, and professor as everyone think he is so intelligent made so many dumb decision as it felt like he is totally a different or dumb version after season 2, lastly writers and creators were just banking on characters popularity as they didn't have any story to begin and end with and now finally when it's over i can gladly say this is just a overrated mess of a show and if you decide to watch it then just go with season 1 and 2 as they were good and made some sense after its bs in the name of revolution and netflix is marketing it as the best series ever but it's just a mistake.",Money_heist

611,mql21,Both entertaining and poor,6/10,25 April 2020,"""Money Heist"" or ""La casa de papel"" is a series whose success resides solely in its capacity to entertain the majority of us. But from an strictly technical point of view, Money Heist survives as a concatenation of sensacionalist sequences that are full of implausibly acquired technology and completely unnecessary moments to generate this constant tone of showmanship. When it comes to the script, despite having some interesting and well-written parts like the relationship between Berlin and Palermo in fourth season, the series abuses the deux ex machina trick making the plot and its formula become pretty bland, predictable and poor.

616,zigzagtom,Season 3 a Bitter Disappointment,5/10,31 July 2019,"Seasons 1 and 2 were excellent, bordering on brilliant. The concepts were novel and well executed, the acting was quite good, the story line was taut and often exciting. Those seasons reflected a very European/Spanish approach. Season 3, however, is a bitter disappointment - it was ""Americanized"" so that now many scenes are pointless sex, needless violence, dialogue from the gutter for no good or artistic reason. I watched seven of the episodes of season 3 but got so disgusted that I walked away from the finale.
What changed? I have no idea, but my guess is that the writers thought they had to pitch Season 3 to an American audience that is used to - and perhaps demands - mindless action, adolescent sex scenes, crude language, and a weak plot. Seasons 1 and 2 are well worth the time; as stated they border on brilliant. Season 3, however, is pure trash. Don't bother with it. If I could rate the seasons separately, I'd give Season 1 a 9, Season 2 an 8.5, and Season 3 a 3.

Stopped watching half way through season 3, it's predictable, boring and just turned into a liberal love fest. Typical Netflix, they can't help ruining everything they get hold of with the liberal stereo typing. They did the same thing with Ozark.

So my advice? Stop after Season 2

628,jesuison,It actually IS good for the first 2 seasons,7/10,9 September 2021,"As so many others have said, the first two seasons are great and anything after is highly questionable. Seasons 1&2 are twisty and turny and really is suspenseful every episode. It was well written, and it was fun. High action soap operas don't need to be so gritty all of the time. There's a bit of an Ocean's Eleven feel to it. Nice to look at, interesting twists, comical, and you're siding with the traditional ""bad guys"". If you really wanted, you could end it after season 2, they give you a complete story. Buuuuut, you know you'll end up watching the next three seasons. Just don't go into it expecting the suspense to be as high. And like others have said, leave logic at the door. The gun battles are seriously... something. It is mostly reused plot lines, which is lazy. Seeing so many low ratings, naaah don't believe that. It actually IS good.... for the first two seasons.",Money_heist

634,curiousdude,The best that's ever been,10/10,23 February 2021,"Sure, there are a few plot holes, and it does drag a bit at times. Not a series I could watch a second time, but I have NEVER seen a series that is smarter, or better at developing the characters. It's also not too heavy on violence and other obscenities.The Plot Holes - Tokyo riding that motor bike into the mint in season two was a bit much for me, and why on earth do they not kick Arturo out of the Bank in season 3? That guy is poison to their operation. BUT I figure its easily worth the ride so go with it.The Beauty - You really can't stop watching it, I felt like I was taking some kind of opiate it was so compelling. Where do you even begin?? These characters are so deep and well developed, half the time they are trying to kill one another and the other they are saving each others lives. The line between heroes and villains is blurred to perfection.As an American, I can see why this show might turn off some my fellow countrymen. American's often times need their shows to be resolved in a neat little package every 60 minutes. Or assuming they do have the IQ to handle a serial program, they need to see perfectly sculpted actors fresh out of a J Crew catalogue. Or worse, they can't make it 30 minutes without a sex scene or someone's brains being splattered. Forgive them, they are an unfortunate group.",Money_heist

After a few episodes I couldn't care less if they succeeded or all got blown up. That is always my rule of thumb - if I stop caring about the characters, I'm out. There's no artistic merit, lots of silly scenes that make no sense, and a lead character who is meant to be creepy and chilly but instead spouts nonsense without any insight.Clearly, there were ideas ripped off from Inside Man. Watch that instead. Clive Owen is brilliant!Should have ended in Episode 4!

649,xara-59700,A telenov√©la that starts off with potential,2/10,1 April 2018,"The series starts off well. The idea and the details in the beginning are well worth watching. Sadly, the creators only care for the HiFi and don't give a crap about the LoFi. Quickly the the characters become stereotypes from a Venezuelan telenov√©la and the story evolves into something that more and more resembles a soap opera much like ""mi gorda bella"". At the end, I have to say I'd be scared as sh** if I lived in a country where during the biggest heist in modern history, the police was so reluctant to do their job that they felt the urge to go on a romantic date with a stranger and waste time and energy on lover's quarrels and jealous outbreaks. The fact that the robbers would be equally as disorganised and incompetent wouldn't worry me less. All of the people involved seem to be utterly incapable of prioritising, which is strange, seeing as they've spent weeks preparing for the heist...
Bottom line to the moral seems to be: Real men are violent and know how to throw a punch. Women are emotional and irrational. Abortion is wrong.
..or maybe this is just the case in Spain...

If you like crime scene, you'll love it.
If you like to see heist, you'll love it.
This is best best series, I've ever seen. It keeps you involve in to the episodes. I didn't get bored in any of the episode. It keeps you thinking what will happen next and show different things. May be you expect something but something different happens. May be you never thought of this to happen. I enjoyed the series a lot. If I see any episode, I feel to see next and next and next till finish. Finished in 3 days completely. Don't compare this to any other series or movie, all have different aspects. I liked all the characters, acting, direction, cinematography and execution. It's the best. Must watch series!

With Season 3 you already know how it works. It's all rinse and repeat with extra foolishness, non sense plot and cringe worthy acting.
I do not have the stamina to go through with Season 4.
Good luck to those looking forward to Season 5. Hats off to you...

659,BingeKing477,A show that overstays its welcome,5/10,4 July 2020,"The problem with this show, and many other shows is that they don't know when to end. First two seasons were great, and had a good arc with a nice end.After that, I feel the producers thought that they could milk more money out of the series and start up a nonsense story which is just plain bad in execution as well. All it did was make the characters that everyone liked filled with cringeSeason 4 at start throws in excessive relationship drama that is unbearable at times, and now it is being dragged to a season 5 as wellOh, and it has probably the dumbest police force ever in a tv series/movieMy advice: I recommend watching seasons 1 and 2, but, stay away from seasons 3 and 4.",Money_heist

I couldn't grasp why I binged every season as soon as it aired. Now I know its because they do a fantastic job at making their entire lives surround around,(and as exciting as it may be) money heists and gunfire. You find yourself in a somewhat familiar story, with the ability to foretell what's going to happen next, while simultaneously wishing it doesn't. The story has something for everyone, from the toxic romance, to the hatred of a loved one, or the rebelling of authority.. it's a fantastic watch that you'll binge without regret.Ps. This is the first show I've ever watched that was dubbed and I wouldn't want it done in English- Seems almost more authentic this way.

the characters are really badass, i love them, so you can't resist to bing watch the whole series.Of course there are tiny logic mistakes , but you don't have to overthink it.Although I think the series should be stopped after season 2, cause it is kinda messy after that, the first two season was literally perfect.I think it's a good choice to kill some characters cause they are criminals and it is a heist after all, but the message of the series is really good, ordinary people like us can't even imagine whats going on between the most powerful politicians and most influential businesspeople.

681,sumit_90@hotmail.com,Entertaining,1/10,12 November 2018,"If you are looking for logic and common sense.... this series is not for you.
Its still a big mystery how they are able to rob the bank. The script is flawed but its nonetheless entertaining and gripping at times.1. They have trained for 5 months together and yet they cannot even get along without pointing a gun at each other every 10 mins or so. While in the flashbacks, they are one happy family.... during the robbery they are the opposite.2. Its unknown when and how the Professor falls in love with Inspector Raquel and vice versa after two meetings. While viewers are mystified ... the Professor risks the whole robbery ( his goal in life ) because he has suddenly met the love of his life.3. Tokyo is unbearable. One does not know if Tokyo's character is supposed to be mentally retarded because she switches from sanity to insanity every 5-10 minutes. There is no explanation for her behaviour given the fact that in the past she has exhibited responsible behaviour and realises the seriousness of the situation.4. The last episode the police is ready to break into the bank, but Miss Nairobi wants to print more notes !! Berlin says no and what happens after that is something u see throughout the robbery....robbers attacking each other personally. Everyone is moving at snails pace while Rio and Tokya get engaged in a conversation about they will do at the beach etc etc. ( i skipped that... it was painful) This is despite orders from the Professor that the police is ready to break in and they should hurry up.
It all looks very forced.... because there was no reason for Berlin to stay there trying to hold the police back. Everyone couldve escaped comfortably. While the audiences can feel the urgency for them to hurry up.... the robbers themselves are in a world of their own. Even inside the vault Oslo asks Nairobi if they can share a flat...with the police a corridor away from the vault ! And then suddenly.. they switch to normal behaviour and realise they need to get the hell out of there..and Berlin decides to stay back to allow the others to escape. Unnecessary... even though they wanted Berlin to die... they could ve scripted it a lot better.
Its a bank robbery of 940( ? ) million Euros and we have been listening to their dreams of what they will do with the money. They trained for 5 months. This is the moment. This is it. Audiences can feel it.... but sadly the robbers cannot.And there are other hundreds of flaws in the script.... the characters are not well defined....but its entertaining nonetheless.",Money_heist

683,Mannequin,It's so stupid!,3/10,24 March 2021,"I want to like this series SO much, I really do, but the silliness is out of control. The level of dramatic fanfare is like that of some action-packed anime. It's just so absurd.If you had to sum up the premise of this series in one sentence it would be: ""Highly trained professionals break into The Royal Mint after months of meticulous planning, and attempt an epic escape."" That's something I can get behind! Unfortunately though, it's riddled with very corny and cheesy plot twists, and at times I want to throw something at my screen.I would recommend watching Season 1 but don't bother going down the rabbit hole of this series. I'm on episode 6 of Season 2 and I'm really not sure how much more of this I can take.

It's not a show that takes itself seriously. It wears its heart on its sleeve, has tons of ideas and energy. This is a cast and crew having loads of fun making this show and that's infectious to watch. Yes it's a soap opera in a way, but no more so than all those highly rated seasons of 24. People need to get over themselves getting so upset about it.

685,axe-s86,"Ridiculous, comical heist, Bloated, exhausting and stretched out Drama",3/10,13 May 2020,"In a nutshell, it's an overrated series with neither good drama nor good heist. I couldn't sit through even season 1 completely. The lowered expectations of audience for a good series are clearly visible from the ridiculously high ratings for what the series offers, I went as far as episode 9 before my head started exploding with sheer boredom of drama, lack of lovable characters despite the overwhelming focus on their backstory and sheer amount of WTF moments during heist. These are robbers who are described as Pro/expert criminals who want to pull off a virtually impossible looking heist, all the while indulging in unbelievable levels of stupidity like Robbers falling in love with hostages, hostages falling in love with robbers, robbers performing surgeries, robbers committing amateur level mistakes and fooling collective intelligence of entire nation's security forces while doing this is something I cannot really find believable. There were few moments of brilliance with detailed planning but everything else going on there during heist was a juxtaposition to that brilliance. I read the detailed plot from 10th episode onwards to the end of second season and was glad i save myself some time and frustration. People who expect some logical explanation, some believable level of professionalism in a heist like this and in general expect some basic level of realism to the plot are going to be disappointed if they watch this series.",Money_heist
686,m_prigipas,Brilliant still and more,10/10,7 April 2020,"I understand the people who like to bring everything down. It is in their nature. All those negative comments for season 3 and 4 is just a reaction. But honesty, seasons 3 and 4 are brilliant in their own way. Are they the same as 1 and 2 ? Of course not and anyone who compares might as well compare oranges and apples. Seasons 3 and 4 deliver something different and just as amazing and emotionally strong. Nuanced relationships between characters. A heist that is not as well thought as the first one and is therefore much more ""imprevisible"". A well executed scenario, amazing performances and beautifully directed scenes. The producers of this show are not doing this for the money or fame (yet): they are doing it for us. I'll be the first to call them out when they get greedy. But it is not yet. And I can't wait for season 5.

687,gabriel_kh,1-2 season were great? Don't think so. The whole show is garbage,3/10,7 May 2020,"I don't understand all the hype around this show. Since the first season it is full of cliches, dumb dialogues, sop opera and gay drama (especially after Netflix picked it up). It's so predictable that you can anticipate the conversation and sometimes even the words the characters are going to say. Many scenes and conversations were so annoying we had to fast forward them. The ideology behind these series is basically one - a bunch of egocentrics trying to get it all convincing all others about their ""noble"" motives.Could't finish the show.

You get to know the characters and come to like some from the start, like others early and then come to dislike them and two of them (for me) were never likeable (one a weasel, the other a bully). The plot twists and turns and leaves you wondering how this new problem will be resoved. Delightful.I recommend against binge watching this. Watch an episode a day -- kind of like a wonderful piece of candy once a day -- it's a treat.

Seeing how much the professor is a geniues makes you intuitive for each plan and each problem happens. A lot of stupid simple problems and mistakes that happenned to get bigger and more diffucult were easy to fix and should've been a part of the plan from the begining since he is always predictible of every problem that might happen and what is the soultion plan for it!The acting in general is good; i'd say the actors who played Berlin, Nairobe and the inspector Seira were very good. But the others were just good.I didn't find the flashbacks, especially the dramatic ones, useful or intresting, they were most of the time boring.Camera, direction and production were at their best.I don't like how they tried to make them look heroes, i mean okay most of us felt emotional toward the thieves, but i didn't understand the protests and the buzz around them in the show.I find the first and second seasons great, i enjoyed them so much, season three was good and averagely entertaining but season four was bad that you can skip directly to ep 7 and you wouldn't miss anything.I just think they should've stopped after season 2.",Money_heist
698,mohammedjaseem,Outstanding!,10/10,15 April 2020,"This series gives a lot of big messages. First of all, Dali masks are not an ordinary choice. Dali is a genius painter who inherited life that is contrary to popular morality and common customs. He has never accepted the imperatives from the society and the right to wrong moral codes. The masks represent this irregularity.Red overalls represent socialism. The wearers are socialist comrades and fighting. Mint and cops represent capitalism. In capitalism money sets everything. Even morals will set money. So when someone attacks the money, those people are declared bad. When attacked by money, capitalism is waging a war against the attackers with its armed and visual mechanisms.The professor is symbolizing the scientific perspective and accounting. After all, scientific thinking and accountability overcome all kinds of problems. But love succumbs.I have not seen such meaningful socialism for a long time. Moreover, Salvador Dali's tactic was used in the series. You think you are watching the events, but every time you have a deep meaning and message. Ciao Bella is the symbol of socialism.Fabulous work. It's not just a movie or a script. It is a wonderful work as a philosophy. There is a great slap in the capitalist system. 10/10",Money_heist

It would've been believable if there was only ONE love interest. Even Berlin fell victim. Above all, the characters didn't even seem in control most of the time! Even the hostages could do whatever they want. In reality, however, people tend to MAXIMISE their abusive power as shown in WW2 and in Prison research. Empathy is unbelievable from the perpetrators, only believable from outside forces (Professor) Due to it's feminist narative I had to skip most of season 2.

704,xacebop-09424,"Saw this before I could find any reviews any on here. It was called ""La Casa de Papel (The House of Paper)"". Here is my unbiased review.",7/10,2 March 2018,"Nowhere near a 9. This show is a great example of when the netflix hype-train runs off the tracks and I will tell you why.
The two main female characters are supposed to be tough and assertive but both become stereotypical ""I have feelings too"" characters you so often see in generic tv/movies. In the case of the police officer, we are talking about a career defining case that will take at most a couple weeks. We're talking about a 24/7 hostage situation which she is solely responsible for. Meanwhile you have a very young child at home who has said she doesn't want to live with you anymore. This is infuriatingly unrealistic. Let's just say for the sake of argument that the character is 42, and that she won't be having any more kids. She is a single parent, her mom who lives with her has Alzheimer's and both her mom and daughter's safety are basically in jeopardy by leaving them unsupervised. Now add in the 24/7 hostage crisis, working (for argument sake) around 18 hours a day. Instead of going home and checking on both of the only loved ones in her life, she frequently goes to get coffee instead of going home. So far, ok, people do shit like this, I can understand. The thing that really crossed the line is that she not only neglects her home life, but willingly divulges unnecessary information to a complete stranger. Again, we are talking about maybe a few weeks of what is really going to either define your career, or ruin it. The few weeks that will decide if your daughter will ever see you again. This entire course of events just seemed forced and unrealistic. She practised no discretion whatsoever (how did she get to the position that she is in in such a field?), her judgment is along the lines of a drunk college girl - spending more time thinking about getting laid then being an adult.The other main female character (the robber), portrays this stone cold vicious attitude, and while other characters also exhibit that, she seems to be ruthless. Guess again. The one person she loved was killed in front of her but that didn't seem to phase her. Her mother even turns her in, still nothing. So she gets involved in this seemingly too good to be true heist and all you have to do is be professional, and don't form inappropriate and personal relationships with your co-workers (which applies to literally any job). Again, ok we are all human she lost a loved one, had her mom flip on her etc. I could understand something like this if she fell in love, but nope. She certainly doesn't love the guy, and I can't imagine how she ever would. He is naive, and practices poor judgment, doesn't have the heart to do what needs to be done, is basically a liability. It just doesn't fit her character to A. act so unprofessionally, and B. risk everything for someone she isn't serious about. Same rules apply to the robber as the cop, we are talking a 24/7 heist, a couple weeks at most, a life-time of either glory, or ruin. And yet again we get the ""I have feelings too"" story-arch superseding an unfathomable amount of money. It just doesn't fit the character to jeopardize that, be a professional thief/robber, and exhibit this kind of behavior during such a critical small amount of time.As you can see this is beginning to become a pattern, and we see it again with the professor to a lesser extent. Basically (aside from the tough exterior) he jeopardizes years of work to get laid. I won't go into detail on the professor, but he really isn't that smart, but neither are the police, so I guess that's okay. I am not sure how the police do things in Spain, but the level of fuck-ups just seems uncharacteristic. We're talking about rogue officers jeopardizing dozes of lives, lack of discretion, poor police-tactics specifically during the raid(s), poor judgment (how the fuck can you not sweep for bugs when the government is sitting in and you obviously have a mole), and on top of that just overall incompetence from everything to PR to gross mishandling of evidence handling. The other detective drinking and driving to such an extent because he is emotional. It is all just so unbelievable, again though I am not Spanish so maybe that is the level of competence that their police show.
As you can see, this is just the characters alone I have I outlined, and why I feel this show doesn't deserve to be rated as high as shows like Westworld, Mad Men, House of Cards, etc. It is actually rated higher than a few of those and just absolutely does not even belong in the same league.The list goes on and I could make the case for other elements, other characters, etc. However, I will say that there are a lot of great things about this show. The plot is great, the 'idea' behind certain aspects of things like characters, methodology, behaviors, even things small things like the masks and fake gun rotation are excellent. The positives do outweigh the negatives, but not to the degree that warrants a near-perfect score.The point of this review was not to bash the show, but to provide a more unbiased opinion (imo) because I experienced it in it's infancy with no real information available (I actually had trouble finding it on imdb). Also, because I feel that someone needs to speak up as the show has obviously been put on a pedestal because Netflix put their name on it.I do recommend this show because on the surface it is something different, and has a lot of unique qualities. It is entertaining, but nowhere near perfect.7/10 at most.",Money_heist
705,yyhh-76995,"Very bad , just wasting time",1/10,4 August 2018,"Since long time, I noticed that Netflix tv show has high good rating here , but i said it's a different opinion, but after this show i'm sure that most rating is fake.. so don't depend on it.

707,jaguarjon53,"Incredible, passionate, intricate, funny heist(s)",10/10,12 January 2022,"Extraordinary and complicated ""impossible"" heist series which encompasses ruminations on love, loyalty and.... economics. No, really. There are multiple interwoven plots with one twist after another, including impromptu musical elements, philosophy and action. The incidental music accompanying various parts of the action comes from all over the world.You may end up thinking ""revolution"". The next time some talking head tells you your country owes billions, ask yourself, to whom? Is it real? If you can print more money every time the ""grown-ups"" mess it up and call it ""quantitative easing"", just how ""real"" is the economy? And, just who are the real thieves?

722,rahmanisepehr,Graaaaeeeeet,10/10,12 May 2020,"The Spanish series ""La Casa De Papel"" with the English name ""Money Heist"", which has been translated into Persian as ""Paper House"", was broadcast for the first time in 2017 on one of the Spanish channels. After that, because the broadcast of this series was welcomed, Netflix decided to broadcast it worldwide. ""Paper House"" is one of the few non-English language series that has found a global audience, and this is a great success for the creators of the series. The Money Heist series was originally made in two seasons, 13 and 9 episodes, and when it was welcomed, its creators decided to continue the series, and seasons 3 and 4 were also made. Also, the fifth season of this series is going to be made. The series received an average of 8.5 points on Imdb with 222,717 votes. One of the reasons why this series is so popular is its very interesting and exciting subject. The biggest robbery in history is going to happen. The use of diverse actors, the creation of different characters and the complexity of the story have attracted a large audience to this non-English language series. But the point is that the series has major flaws that prevent it from becoming a lasting series. The reason for this can also be the haste in turning exciting and compelling ideas into a powerful script. The story of this series is about a group of thieves with a personal group called Professor who want to rob a money printing plant in Madrid, Spain",Money_heist

731,steventot,South American telenovela with action,4/10,20 August 2019,"This is one of the worst highly rated shows ever.
It is full of plotholes and stupid decisions from the characters, if you want to watch a clever show, this is not it!
The plot seems interesting, initially, but the further you watch the dumber it gets.
Season 3 is a bit better but the whole series is not worth your time if you are looking for a quality TV show.
Sometimes it is so dumb, I wishI didn't watch any of it!
How is the ratingabove 8 is beyond me!?
A lot of people have their standards these days very low it seems!

I think it is totally opposite!!! Netflix gave this show something super important, emotions. Final episode of season 3 was just fantastic.

I'm hooked.I love how the story unfolds piece by piece and keeps you interested. And the casting and characters are just fantastic. What really strikes me personally as refreshing, is how believable the characters are. And all interesting in their own way. There's none of that typically forced American politically correctness pushing some obvious agenda that just ends up annoying you and ruining the immersion.Give it a shot! It's well worth it.

There is much pathos although a little overdone and the numerous flashbacks are a pain as they interrupt the action unnecessarily. Of course it's far fetched but would you rather watch a film of someone mowing their lawn? I for one am looking forward to part 5.

There are plenty of brilliantly staged scenes. Before anything else, there is an attempt to rob a different venue, with a different style. And, of course, as with every robbery plan, there's a situation where your home account does not fit the bazaar. Flashbackler has been used in many places. By finding yourself in the past, you can look at events with that eye. To tell you the truth, even some dramatic scenes made in order to complete the period are never squeezed.One of the most important criterions in the series of bloody me is shudder: When you finish watching a part, does it make you sadly open your next episode? So does he have dragging? Or is it that you are not satisfied with the subject after you finish it, and are you looking for another set or movie just to finish the night? Here is the cinsten that definitely opens you to the next episode.And finally: Let's say, for the sake of the man they have given, if they are trying to beat this place with 2-3 sentences sitting in front of the computer at home, you know that you are just doing it yourself; ""I am not like the others, I am a person with different perspectives, others can not see my views, I am walking in the extreme, I am a marginal person, the best critic I am, I am irritable ..."" already...",Money_heist
753,kdc-43167,It's a Love-Hate relationship,7/10,22 August 2019,"The content is really exciting! The storyline is good. However, there is way too much drama and unprofessional behavior for even a guy like the Professor to pull off...
It's a case of conflicting motivations. They are attempting to be precision Type A always on personality jobs being accomplished by type B slackers. Socialism's number one believers. It's a really cool thing they are doing. It's just entirely unrealistic that those people could pull it off.
Another common case of taking away from the type of character and devotion to craft it would take to excel in this area. People that could do this don't make mistakes. They don't bicker and fight amongst each other. Think mission impossible, James Bond, Thomas crown affair, the Italian job.
These are the kinds of people that screw off at work, use their phones 1/4 to 1/2 the shift, groan and mope if something unexpected comes and it gets busy. Don't go out of their way to help the boss if he asks. Definitely always wondering why they don't get pay raises more often. Etc etc.
The writer is trying to get out of that category but I have to call BS on Rio getting caught for using a phone. They could call each other daily for 3 hours a day using prepaid phones. The satellite phones are a whole different story, not that they needed them. Not because they could have any possible way of knowing that Rio had the phone it was third party. Then they would be using prepaid sat phone Sims. So no chance they would know. It was just lazy.",Money_heist

So much, nano level planning happens only in reel not in real. Hats off to the writter. still a great come back after 2 seasons where it ends originally.

The premise is good and the first few episodes are good but it goes down hill rapidly about halfway way through the first series. There are so money things wrong with it make it at first laughable so you turn a blind eye. But when they keep writing in preposterous and contrived scenarios it just becomes annoying.Spoiler Alert.How is it that the chief negotiator/police officer can just keep leaving the scene for coffees, beers, dinner, sex etc and nobody bats an eyelid?How can the mastermind behind it walk in to secure crime scenes multiple times and nobody questions it, they just let him in.? This despite the Chief of Intelligence and his team being on site 24 hours a day.When Tokyo decides to storm back in to the mint. Dozens of armed trained marksman do not manage to get a single shot to hit her?When some of the hostages escape by blowing a big hole in the wall the robbers just happen to have a big spare metal door to prop up and cover the hole. Hey, we all have one of them lying around don't we?That's just a sample of the ludicrous issues you are supposed to just swallow as a viewer. I can put up with the odd plot hole but here they drive through it and demolish what's left of it as they do. By the time you get to Series 2 you really don't care about any of the characters any more. I was rooting for some of them to die just so I wouldn't have to listen to their ridiculous whining any longer. I didn't care about the hostages, the robbers or the police by the time I got to two episodes in to series two.I would give series one 7 stars but series 2 doesn't deserve any. Not bothering with three and four as just don't care any more.

Fantastic writing, great suspense, good acting (You've got to watch it with the subtitles, otherwise you'll lose the charm of the characters) Brilliant storyline. I don't know where they can go from here, but I can't wait to find out.If you liked Prison Break, Breaking Bad, then you'll love Money Heist (LA CASA DE PAPEL) I promise you. Subtitles are quite fast at times, but you get used to it.

During season one, the show was building up to reveal why el professor decided to do this and the reason is because his father didn't make it?!!! Really? And that's admirable why? Had they given all the money away, I would say yay! But they kept most of it for themselves. Am I missing something? If they weren't masked as heroes I wouldn't mind. But I am having a hell of a difficult time understanding why I should sympathize.",Money_heist
758,nishantsalhotrans,Disappointing but watchable,7/10,10 April 2020,"Season 1 review:The idea of this show is pretty good but the execution is disappointing. I would rate it a 6.5/10. It was like watching a worse version of Prison Break. The pace is really slow, with some ironically rushed direction. 13 episodes cover 70 hours in the story. That's 6 days, when we've been told from the beginning that the heist will last 10-12 days.The season is full of unnatural and forced romantic sub-plots, like no other movie/show I've seen before. Hostages are getting romantically involved with their captors like it's nothing. The number of times one of the criminals messes up just because of their horniness is unbelievable. People who've known each other for few hours or days are acting like Romeo and Juliet. Apart from the overuse of romance, there are many other flaws. The main police negotiator is mentally weak and emotionally incapable of doing her job. She would go out with a stranger in the middle of a globally followed hostage scenario. She flips out on her colleague of 15 years and calls him a rat without any actual investigation or proof. Apart from that, thieves are made to look like priests, preaching the hostages about life in certain scenes. Too much focus has gone towards showing emotional scenes even where it makes absolutely no sense. Character development is very messy and rushed, (given the time they spent on it) except for Tokyo, who's backstory was told before she was shown engaging with her new team.If you ignore the bad writing and direction, the main story is pretty good and hence it's passively watchable.",Money_heist

760,jeste_taj,Huge potential wasted,7/10,8 December 2018,"Good show for an average viewer who doesnt pay atention to details and waches the picture as a whole..
The story is great and had potential but they ruined it with silly descisions and unreal situations,like swat teams having 0 accuracy,police being realy dumb,silly situations all over the place that make 0 sense,made both by kidnapers and hostages :)
Main characters are lacking,Berlin killed it tho,props to him!..Profesor was decent,Father and son were both amusing,they brought raw emotion to the show,but the rest were meh,especialy Rio and Tokyo,oh boy,those 2 ruined the show halfway for me,especialy Tokyo,character with no point basicly but to be a sexy bad ass female,going around acting like a 13 y old girl on a period..and that motor bike scene almost made me quit waching the show lol
If the director used the power of logic,for example,if 10 police offficers are shoting auto rifles a bullet is bound to hit something,i mean they had years and years of training,or say,hey that person has a brain,no way hed think and do something as stupid and ilogical as that..
Or for example give more air time to Berlin and not focus on the ""love story"" and feminist bad ass super cool but constantly on her period Tokyo the show could have been 10/10",Money_heist
761,edlaxton,Flawed,5/10,11 January 2018,"Strong points are the cast and the ingenious plotting. But after the first few episodes it starts to drag and but episode 10 you're into ""sunk cost fallacy"" - I've spent 10 hours of my life on this series so it make sense to see it through to the end.But doing so and you have to endure the most absurd plot holes and character behaviour. The lead cop takes off for the evening and leaves her mobile phone off for 24 hours whilst the siege reaches a climax; snipers are ordered to shoot one of the gang on the roof but only fire one shot, allowing the gang member (hostage in a mask) to live; hostages blow a hole in the wall and escape but the police, apparently having no snipers to fell the villains, nor flash-bangs to subdue them, fail to enter the building, thereby prolonging the siege. ""Alison Parker, daughter of the British Ambassador"" does not appear to have been anywhere near Britain. All very silly and just moderately entertaining.",Money_heist
762,nielsen_thomas,Good till the very end,9/10,7 September 2021,"Usually a series gets badder by the time. But I really love this , also the last seasons , don't really get all the bad ratings , sure the 1-2 first seasons a many times the best , because that's where you fell in love with a show , and often in the end of a show - the core or heart of the show is lost or forgotten.. but I really believe and feel that la casa de papel keeps it original and intense right to the very end ( as far as I have I seen yet) ( first half of season 5)The only thing that is needed is maybe a little more content between some of the characters , or a little bit more knowledge into the story. As I we have a lot of scenes and jumps in the storyline that a not chronologically. Some times things goes to fast or to slow. There could easily have been a few more episodes , concerning this.But that should not take a away that this is one of the best show I have seen so far !And serious ??? 1-4 rating.. that is just dumb.. really. And it ain't fair..If you want to write reviews and rate it.. be fair. Or else all this I useless..Peace out from DK

763,kumarujjal,Either we both win or we both lose!,8/10,3 December 2021,"The series that started off just as a heist ended on a very dramatic note, leaving the world wondering who's the good guys and who's the bad ones! LCPD became famous because of its thrilling nature and the same was missing in P5 Vol.1 that's why I was sceptical about P5 Vol. 2 but it did bring the emotions back. I didn't liked some of the subplots put in between the main storyline. At times, it feels like the cops were sleeping and doing nothing while the robbers are executing Plan Chernobyl, Plan Tom Thumb and what not! It was an overkill for me for sure.The writing and direction of the series was top notch. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time and that's the best part about Money Heist. If I go onto talk about the performances then this piece would become 10 pages long. Let's just say that, they were natural in what they're doing and I liked it.Overall, I enjoyed watching this series and I'm glad they are stopping this heist here. Now let's focus on Berlin's spinoff.",Money_heist

766,YourBossHere-00,Definetly overhyped but not bad.,7/10,20 June 2020,"So if u r planning to watch a series with logics and believable things happening then u will get disappointed and will rate it with one star.But if u r going to watch it then just keep your sharp mind aside and don't find logic in everything u see just enjoy the ride.The show is good not great and definetly not the greatest thing u will watch anywhere. The show has its own plus points and its own minus points.This show will make u question alot of things but u will have to just agree with the director and go with the flow.The story is not about one heist but about two heists that the group does.The storyline is good and will keep u hooked but at some points it also becomes stupid.Season 1 was great,Season 2 was also good but not as good as Season 1. The problem starts with Season 3 where it becomes a bit slow and illogical and starts losing its main plot but yes it will not bore you neither will you stop watching it. Season 4 is pretty bad to be honest u don't feel much connected in the starting episode but it slowly picks up its pace and in the ending episodes it takes u on a thrilling ride. It ends with a good cliffhanger and Season 5 is also on cards.The acting of everyone here is great and u start rooting for some characters. Berlin being my favourite here. The whole cast does justice to the characters they were given and everyone is a perfect fit especially the Professor with his brilliant mind games.It's a good series and u will definitely watch it after season one ends but absolutely not as great as anyone will say this series is.",Money_heist

769,keastgary,Overblown seasons 3 & 4,5/10,13 August 2020,"Can't help but agree with recent reviews in that seasons 3 and 4 are utterly forgettable. Whole episodes drift with very little happening. The plots just get more and more bizarre and at times certain episodes threaten to turn into a musical. This really should've stopped after season 2. The gang were rich beyond their wildest dreams so the gold heist makes no sense at all.

Anyone curious to watch this show, watch the first two seasons! You will not regret it. The show should have ended there, though. It dragged out, because the show runners enjoyed the popularity and wanted more profits so they decided to make more seasons and repeat the same story heist. Which is disappointing as it ruins the show gradually.But you could give the third and fourth season a shot if you wanted and maybe you would even like it. Either way, the story does have some plotholes here and there. The professor should have known that bringing in a group of socially awkward people with issues was going to create a 'family' and that is what led to their downfall. They succeed if barely, but now they are wanted criminals internationally. They had everything they want. Plenty money, they could 'go home' and have a good life. But no, they jump back in to do another heist. I do not now about you, but if I had millions I would lay low and lead a good life.

787,manuelklepser,What happens when a character study show runs out of character study?,8/10,6 September 2021,"The first 2-3 seasons are exquisite, unique TV. At the end of season 3 however, they start to run out of character depth to explore, which was partially what made the earlier seasons so great.In S4, they try to make up for this with too many flashbacks, especially to Berlin's life. In S5 they make up for it with too many action sequences that most of their audience find dull and unoriginal.",Money_heist
788,muntaqaakhan,They should have stop upto the Royal Mint story but bring up the Bank of Spain was unnecessary,6/10,13 July 2021,"When I first saw Money Heist, I was so interested of its story, it was so sophisticated. The characters like, The Professor, Berlin, Nairobi, Denver etc, were great and I loved them but the characters like Tokyo and Arturo are real threat to the heist. Whatever happens to Rio, Tokyo always do something stupid which would jeopardize the plans of crew's heist. As for Arturo, he was the most disgusting character I ever imagined, a coward, always put innocent lives at stake. I always hated these two.I loved the first two seasons, it was so great but they should labelled as limited series. When I saw the third and fourth season of Money Heist, i lost interest of this series as I felt it wasn't necessary but I continued to watch and finished it.

792,politicalnewage,Season 5 - One Star,10/10,8 September 2021,"I absolutely LOVE this show. I recommended it to people. Although some parts corny, it was full of suspense. Seasons 1&2 were best and they could have closed out the show there. Then comes season 3 and 4. Interesting but squeezing a little bit. Now comes season 5. I'm excited, like a kid on Christmas. To my surprise it was absolutely awful. I felt like turning it off after ep 1, however I thought it may turn around but the following episodes were worse and worse. Season 5 was a complete letdown. It was a mess, and I'm hoping part 2 of season 5 can salvage some of the damage. Terrific show, however as the seasons go on, and especially season 5, it begins to decline.

795,srm-1,"What's Spanish for ""yawn""?",2/10,24 March 2018,"This show wants so much to be taken as a serious crime caper, but lacks any kind of believable hard edge in its execution, so much so that that were the sex (needless) & violence (comic book) removed, it could easily be rebroadcast as children's TV.The ""heist"" itself could be (and should have been) whittled down from 19 episodes (13 in Series 1 + 6 in Series 2) to about 3. There is more filler in this than in your local DIY store, so much so that what little drama actually remains is diluted and left to drown in an ocean of ponderous navel-gazing, tedious monologues and largely irrelevant side stories. The lesson seems to be that if you are ever invited on a job with a group of Spanish robbers, along with your M16 and explosives don't forget to pack some Belgian chocolates, a dozen red roses and a box of condoms. Just in case.But, of course, the real elephant in the room: even non-criminals these days know that a large amount of unaccounted for cash is basically worthless. Didn't the phrase ""money laundering"" ring any bells with The Professor or, more importantly, the writers? Try buying something relatively small like a new car with cash and see how far you get without having to first prove where the money came from.Modern professional thieves are more interested in precious stones, rare metals or untraceable bonds and steer clear of large amounts of paper money. Yet here we are in 2017 and a gang of dimwits think they are committing the crime of the century running off with nearly a billion Euros in freshly minted paper currency, 963 million of which is in the same denomination. It's the crime of the century all right, but the last century - not this one. Years of planning and they'd all be caught and banged up within a matter of weeks.",Money_heist
796,icazares,It was going to be a 9,7/10,6 December 2021,"I loved this series. But I'm glad I didn't rate it before the last episode. IMO, the finale ruined the whole thing. Absolutely no sense. I know, it's a history that doesn't make sense in its entirety, especially the rationale behind the 2nd heist. But the last episode is the straw that broke the camel's back. Let's see:Why would the government of Spain let them go? There is nothing to win for the country. The gold is lost, if we believe the story. By letting the band go free and unpunished (and actually giving them new passports) they have over 10 people with direct knowledge of the greatest national secret roaming around... 10 people that can destroy the country's economy in a heart bit. 10 blackmailers. No service secret would follow that script.What's the story with Berlin's son? He's at the center of one of the best twist of the series only to give up the gold later on? What's his true alliance and nature?They won both times (mint house and Bank of Spain). Really? And the Professor ends up alive? What about a semi heroic Breaking Bad like finale where the Professor attempts to redeem himself after destroying the lives of all the surviving members of the band. What about the potential emotional struggle with Alicia and the Professor? That didn't happen either?Disconcerting. I can only assume that the pressure was on to end up in a high note. They broke to pieces the series with a Disney-like finale. All happiness, just a tad short of resurrecting Nairobi and Tokyo.",Money_heist

It is therefore a mystery to me why the story of Casa de papel should be spread over 4 seasons. Deserves no more than 4 stars.

802,steve-kettel,Are we watching the same show?!,4/10,9 March 2018,"I can only assume that these positive reviews have been paid for, or are from people who have seen a very limited amount of shows! This is average, at best. To give my reasons:The overacting is incredible; from people visibly shaking to show that they are under stress, to manic grins and laughter at totally unamusing jokes. For a bunch of ""professionals"", the characters constantly make ridiculous, stupid decisions. I mean laugh out loud stupidity.The plot is paper thin after an intriguing start, and still managed to slow down to walking pace in the middle. There is misogyny and homophobia throughout. The plot holes are to numerous to mention.Having said that, I did watch it all, sometimes in disbelief, and mainly because my OCD won't let me stop half way. What a shame that a decent idea and set up could be wasted like this. How on earth people can make this a highly rated show I will never know.

If your idea of a good show is bad characters, scenes full of coincidence to suit the story, terribly predictable attempt of 'cliff hangers"" and a cringey love story thrown in then this will be the show for you. I expect these things when I watch certain shows and can get on board.... not a heist movie.

It's written in the usual millennial style: lengthen the thing again and again. And again.But the worst aspect is watching the characters having relationships and often taking the dumbest possible decisions. I would like to say they are totally unrealistic, but it's worse, it's like watching the Big Brother on tv: a bunch of crazy, narcissistic and brainless guys, fu**ing, fighting and switching sides all the time.Tokyo, Rio and Angel are extremely unlikeable, Nairobi and Denver almost are. Some of them are very badly acted. On the other hand, Berlin and Moscow are interesting and well acted characters. The Professor is just, well, the Professor.

Direction and acting topnotch and is definitely a must watch series.
P.S.- don't make too much expectation with season 4.

No matter what.Thieves make stupid decisions very often.Thieves, policemen and the soldiers have very poor aim.Inside the tent, the policemen track any radio frequency, except the microphone which is being carried by Angel Rubio in his glasses. That microphone is crucial for the development of the robbery...The thieves lived together for several months, but after 48 hours after the robbery began they are threatening each other. This happens multiple times in less than five days.There are shooting scenes where police/military ARE ABLE TO shoot or throw grenades, but they never take advantage these situations.There are thieves who, being at least 3 meters from the hostages, do not hear them speak.It is not explained why neither Marsella nor Bogot√° nor Manila are part of the first robbery.Hostages without being surveillanced on more than one occasion.Everything seems to be hackable: a sliding door, advertising signs, the surveillance system of the most important bank in Europe...Intelligence guys (CNI) are not so lucid and sagacious.Once inside, how the hell did they take the extraction pump to the basement?

822,mackeanjunior,Award for the Most Overhyped Show for a Horrible Category.,2/10,13 August 2020,"I am so glad I had to watch this show on tour. Luckily multitasking was the only way to go because I initially had a very bad feeling about this show. The hype on twitter and from friends was Literally driving me nuts and I really had to see for myself. Thank God I ended it around episode 3 of season 1. It was just too painful and terrible that I could just pick a gun and blow my brains out. Please DO NOT WASTE your time.To be honest, everything from the script, screenplay and characters are just so terrible. Their delivery comes off as too over-the-top and obnoxiously far from reality.I enjoyed the subtle references of the red robs to communism and The face mask to a certain figure who made history in morality. Other than that I just think that the people who overhyped this show for it to be forcefully accepted by the cinema lovers via shear peer pressure from social media, are just fans of TeleNovellas and soap opera lovers who have just been exposed to another way to tell heist+love stories. It's to dull for adults and sometimes too explicit for kids. I literally do not see a reason for anyone to watch this, even if you're planning a heist in real life this is the worst tutorial video you can watch.Save your time and go plant a tree in your backyard instead.

825,Keallach,A disjointed melodrama masquerading as a caper,5/10,19 April 2020,"We've only watched the first 2.5 episodes of S1, but it looks like that's going to be it. The premise promises a thrilling caper type series, but it's just not that. It's more melodrama and bungling, which isn't what we signed up for or intriguing. We just don't care about any of these characters or believe they could pull off such a heist.Her Take: I feel baited and switched. I hate that.His Take: Too many scenes feel like they were included just because someone wanted to film them. It makes the plot disjointed, unengaging and unbelievable.

828,nunchux,Cheesy and unoriginal.,3/10,21 August 2019,"Considering this show's rating and recommendations from friends, I was expecting a good show. In reality, it's below average.The good things are the visuals and their main plan to print money rather than steal existing money.The masks are just knock offs of V for Vendetta. The code names and rules scene is straight out of Reservoir Dogs. So what's new? You have specialists like Oceans 11, except here, they are all immature morons that you wonder why the ""genius"" professor picked them. Tokyo and the main detective are unbearably annoying and the way the plot move is ridiculous.A ridiculous plot would be fine if the show leaned into with a funny tone like Guardians of the Galaxy, but this show takes itself so seriously as if it is Breaking Bad and you roll your eyes.In the first episode, when the show thinks it is at its most epic, the narrator says, ""We went through this plan 30 times. We shoot near the police...but the professor never said...the police would shoot back""...SERIOUSLY?That's another thing, narrating/voice over is the laziest kind of writing. It's always better to SHOW not constantly TELL.Being over an 8/10 is really over rating this thing.",Money_heist

I could watch up to the first 3-4 or so episodes of the first season before i had to go away and vomit mentally and stop there.I take it the huge success this show has been is an interesting indicator of how primitive our society still is, and how much it is comprised of apes who enjoy a brainless but decently shot drama that insults all logic and intelligence.I generally only read reviews and not write them but i guess i was in a mood to rant. One of those days i guess.

If this kind of logic, supporting the crime and illicit relations is acceptable to our coming generation then the world has really changed and senior citizens like me, who believe in morals, ethics and good nature are fools in today's world. The first two seasons have some merit but the next seasons are utterly foolish and showing the entire Spanish police force and their intelligence as a dumbest lot.

848,UKHerbie,Could have been so much better,6/10,15 April 2020,"I've just finished watching series 2 and signed up to IMDB for my first review as I was left feeling so frustrated by La Casa de Papel !
I won't repeat the story line as others have already done this but the story is sound and the acting good for the most part but the massive problem with this is it is sooooo drawn out and overlong.
The first few episodes drag you in then there are overly long, often unnecessary scenes that seem to be just ""filler"" and by the end of series 1 you question whether or not to continue.
I did and by episodes 3-4 of series 2 considered stopping watching but persevered. By episodes 7-8 I found myself fast forwarding the inevitable long, drawn out scenes to get back to the story line.
The last 2 episodes of series 2 were excellent and what things should have been like all along with a good ending (in my view).
Will I be watching series 3 & 4 ? Not a chance - even if I'd not read the already poor reviews of these my time spent watching this have come to an end.
Bottom line is would I recommend this to a friend and I'm disappointed to have to say no - as I say it could have been sooooo much better but could I recommend someone spent 20 hours of their life watching this ? I'm afraid not.
Such a shame !",Money_heist

851,sapkotaprasant-19778,Give a try.,7/10,1 May 2020,"After completing all four seasons , I must say this is one of the best series i have ever watched . The first two seasons were really good . The story screenplay dialogues everything is compelling. The quality of this show is, it can make you fall for the bad guys. Even though they are thief you root for them see through their eyes.
They have done a lot of research on the character , they all have the background story ,pain, grief , and all the reasons for what they are doing. The story is portrayed in a such way that you will fall for the character. The character aren't made so superficial though they are good for what they do they all have their weakness.
First and second season were the continuation of the same story so it was good. Though they tried to connect the story in third season , it's not quite convincing. Season three was really like it should stop but the season four looks like it is back in track. But i must say it could never match that height of season 1.

858,harry_goel,Interesting but flawed and frustrating,4/10,12 April 2020,"While the plot is interesting, it also feels frustrating. It feels like it's being stretched to add episodes and seasons. The plot looks extremely fabricated and implausible, particularly from Raquel's perspective - the way she freely carry her newly founded boyfriend (Salva) around to critical investigations and police sites.
Is Spain's law agencies really that dumb?
And then Raquel is shown to have streaks of brilliance and out-of-box thinking and then she doesn't connect obvious dots, all to suit the vagaries of the plot.
Circumstances always suit the Professor somehow.
Would I recommend watching it - maybe yes but not for the brilliant script as the script has too many flaws that frustrate the life out of you at least once per episode.

864,vmps-1,Seriously overhyped series,4/10,17 April 2020,"Where do I begin? Started watching mainly due to the very positive reviews and high scores given to this serial.My opinion -The basic heist uses a storyline used before many times, as early as 30 years ago, where the hostages would be made to dress up as the criminals to evade arrest.The acting was amateurish overacting, at best. A high school could probably put up a much more professional production.There was zero suspense. It fails to grip. I'm comparing this to a serial like 24, which I was unable to switch off as it had me on the edge of my seat !!!There are far too many intermingled story lines that waste a great deal of time.Watching this is almost akin to watching grass grow !!!I honestly cannot understand all the high scores given to this.In short, the ongoing pandemic situation around the world has us homebound with nothing to do.

Session 3 & 4, deserve just 1 üåü rating, story is full of loopholes, it fills like they created few milestones first and then tried to create story Coz you see caracter appearing on need basis, 1 is understandable but it happened 2-3 times.In Season 4, i skipped all non heist related scenes. I am not sure if i missed this but from where they got so much of fuel to keep the furnace burning? Hostage from prev heist enters who caused so much chaos enters forcefully, why not just force him to leave? Or put a tape on hostages to avoid them screwing plan? The chase with Gandia was boring as hell, 4 ppl shooting at 1 person but not even 1 targeting on his head? Also if you dont want to send him on terrace then why even bring him to door? This show is completely illogical by season 3, mockery of police system and viewers.

871,antonsenlarsen,"Starts off strong, steadily turns into an annoying parody.",2/10,21 July 2020,"This show is misleading. It starts off as an intelligent, high budget well-done action series with strong acting and athmosphere. Then it all rapidly goes downhill. By season 4 it's as if no one no longer care what they put on the screen.Gunfights and character behaviour is often ridicolous. I'm not sure if they are trying to make a comedy or a parody, but it does not fit the show.People constantly pointing guns at friendlies, both with intent and many times on accident. (Tokyo with AR on her shoulder with the nose of the gun almost inside Denvers mouth while walking)Arturo Roman on the roof, ignoring snipers, until the last second, when he turns TOWARDS them right before they shoot.Tokyo driving a motorcycle back in to The Royal Mint, while getting shot at by several snipers and all the ground units, they all missGandia getting shot at by 4 assault rifles, 100+ bullets, and doesn't get hit. He wears a hood though, that's probably what saved him.Tokyo sits inside a sound proof room, screaming doesn't work, but when people start singing, she hears it.People go out of character to start stupid fights all the damn time. They have not cared about something for 3 seasons, and all of a sudden it's the end of the world for them.Generally way too many flashbacks forcing information down the viewers throat, completely ruining the momentum.etc. etc. etc. etc.I got to season 4, episode 6, at that point I could not continue. It just hurt to watch it.",Money_heist
872,sidgate,A soap opera under heist genre,2/10,1 June 2021,"I love heist movies/series. But this is not one. The more you watch, the more you get annoyed. You can hope the characters to behave sensibly eventually, but that doesn't happen.Stupid criminals loving criminals, hostages loving criminals, police loving police, criminal loving police, hostage loving hostages. Every stupid love combination. That too in a heist that supposed to be planned enough.The worst part is the plot holes. All criminals gathering together too often only to leave the hostages alone long enough to plan escapes.Don't waste time over this, instead just rewatch your favorite movie.

I'm very disappointed. Other things that I disliked about the show: there were action scenes where they were firing 100s of bullets at each other just a few meters apart & nobody gets shot lol or scenes where they are in extreme danger & they need to get away ASAP but they keep talking or they discuss their romantic problems. I advise anyone to only watch the 1st 2 seasons. Don't waste ur time

If it wasn't funny it would be really sad.It's more like a telenovela where writers run out of the ideas for the story and they add crying, shooting, retrospective scenes every 5 minutes, hostages here and there and some sexual scenes.The main point why I watched this show in the first place is the robbery, which is in the 6th or even 10th place in this show. I was hoping for a story to be focused more on the robbery.

876,Beevy,Classic mistake,5/10,3 December 2021,"Another typical example of a series starting out really good but that just doesn't know when to stop. That point was the finale of season 2. At that point I rated the series an 8 and it would have left a good memory for me. However it went on with season 3, 4 and now 5 and just got worse and worse. I also got super allergic to the hyped-up scenes where someone looks like some badass superhero and finishes it with cringy one-liners. The clich√© and cringe visions of the creators were forgiven because it had a clever story for the first two seasons. However, from season 3 on, hyped up cringe and clich√© is all that remains and it just becomes kind of a drag to watch.

880,StefanMM,A celebration of mediocrity.,1/10,30 August 2018,"This is a low-level soap opera that anyone with any intelligence or self-respect will stay away from. Trivial, unimaginative, over-dramatized...and just empty on every level. Bad writing, bad acting, cliche after cliche and superficial love stories behind every corner. Everything is somehow too personal and in your face, without any taste or nuance. Characters exchange mean gossipy blows below the belt that even teenage girls wouldn't think of. Imagine the first interaction between two high-level detectives solving the hostage crisis being ""I know about your problems with your ex-husband"". Yes, it's that stupid. Oh, and the damage this show will do -- male characters constantly make rude/ sexist comments, while one of the female characters (uneducated, loud, over-confident and arrogant) slaps them for it and wins the day. Laughably cheap and obnoxious, but I'm afraid effective attempt to push her as role model to young girls. God save us..

So many random stuff.
In a scene there are 4 guys with automatic rifles in a open space, and cant hit the guy who do a roll like a video games to dodge the bullets.
There is another scene in a hall exactly the same. Same guy in the middle, open hall, being shot by 3 diferent angles by 4-5 guys, and no one hit.
Even call of duty its more realistic than this.
The crew are idiots 90% of the time, and super brillant the other 10%, no middle point.

Several self contradictory plot holes can be found.The show is still gripping in the sense the overall plot is pretty great and the actors have done well.But the biggest flaw in the show that i wanted to mention was Tokyo's acting. Was she supposed to be the protagonist? She was basically the character I least identified with, in fact i found her deeply annoying (the character and the acting).In the end, season 1 was really good. 9/10. season 2 was a drag, almost as if the show writers made the show with the intent of ""stalling time"".

889,alex-frgi,"8/10 for Season one and two, 5/10 for the rest.",7/10,10 April 2020,"Good things
1. Amazing acting from most of the cast. Especially the professor. This is what carries the show.
2. Some of the script. The clever ideas from the professor, like when they switch the masks of everybody so the two SWAT team guys cannot infiltrate. Also when they put a hidden microphone in the glasses of Angel.
3. Good intro song.
4. Great disguises of the heroes when they finish the heist.
5. Bella Ciao song.Bad Things
1. It was nice one time when the Denver and Berlin pulled Guns at each other in the toilet, because Denver was in love with Monica. However, after that this trick of ""pulling guns at each other without shooting"" has been used sooo many times that it is too much.
2. Characters creating drama for no reason, just to make something happen or to help the plot. For example, when Tokyo suddenly pulls a gun on Berlin (Russian roulette), and then later Berlin throws her out of the bank. This was a very stupid decision from Tokyo, and no one would do that in real life.
3. Berlin Sacrificing himself in the end, when there was no need for it. They could just have gone in the tunnel and then blow it up. A person sacrificing himself is already a clich√©, so when it is being used it must make sense and be very clever.
4. The SWAT team waited to storm the building until the LAST MOMENT when the robbers finished to print all the money. In the begging they were worried about hostages and in the end they didn't care. That is a very sudden change of mind from the police/government, which is convenient for the plot. I think that they should either storm the building right away, or not storm it at all to try and save the hostages.
5. When the SWAT team actually storm the building, we see the most stupid and unrealistic gun fight. Both sides shoot at each other for a long time and no one gets killed.
6. The scene with Tokyo is coming back through the main door on a motorcycle WITHOUT GETTING SHOT. That is just unbelievable and unrealistic. Even when the professor saves her from an armed police transportation, that is just too much. I mean these guys are already stealing 2,4 billion euro or whatever, but now they also have to be like superman/wonder woman and get Tokyo away from an armed police truck. Tokyo should not have been acting stupid from the beginning and then all that other stuff would not have happened.
7. Not everything has to be in the last second. Raquel gives the address of professors secret location to the Swat team, and they storm the place 1-2 minutes after the heroes escape
8. The scene where the professor smashes the coffee cup from grandmothers hand. If the grandmother cannot remember that, then how the is she able to take care of her granddaughter and herself?
9. Unrealistic portrayal of gunshot wounds. When Arturo and Monica get shot, they get a small surgery and in a couple of days they are okay. In real life, if someone gets shot in the shoulder or in the leg, they would probably take months if not years to recover. I don't know the exact timeline, but it is not a few days. You can google it if you want.
10. Like other reviewers have pointed out, they are the bad guys, so it does not make sense to just let them get away with the money to live in Paradise. Instead maybe they could have burned the money and give some sort of message to the government. It is like the movie ""Inside Man"" where they also rob a bank, but they don't take any money, they only steal some documents to bring down a corrupt former nazi guy. Or maybe they should just end up in jail, I don't know what exactly, but there has to be some consequences or some good-moral-reason-explanation to why they are doing it. Or else this whole ""resistance"" and bella ciao theme does not make sense if they just drink Pina Colada in the Caribbean.
11. Season 3, 4.Other Notes
The relationship between the professor and Raquel has some similarities with Breaking Bad. Here I mean Walter and Hank.The idea of giving hostages the same disguise as the robbers is from the movie ""Inside Man""",Money_heist

892,superso,This show is SO corny but entertaining,4/10,14 June 2018,"This is the type of show you can zone out and watch for pure entertainment. It's just so fake and difficult to believe that it's more like a fantasy movie. Who believes that a country's (Spain) national mint has 4 cops guarding it and no one responding to a robbery for 10 hours? The federal reserve in NYC has about 200 armed security and thousands more within a mile.This show also gets to me because they are trying too hard to be ""cool"" and pretending to be a hollywood movie and it comes across as just lame. For example, a bunch of cops hanging out near a forensics scene - nowhere near a dangerous area - will be wearing full protective gear and black helmets in order to look cool. A bunch of cops inside a tent will hear ""Alright, let's get ready to go in"" and they'll unlock the safety on their rifles with a loud click for dramatic effect. It's ridiculous.

893,superso,This show is breathtakingly bad,4/10,18 June 2018,"There are so many false dramatic moments because there's not enough to keep a person interested. It's probably the most unrealistic show i've seen in my entire life. From the fact that the police can't aim at all, to the fact that these amateurs can take on dozens of armed police and somehow come out on top each time (and never reload) and rarely get hit by the thousands of bullets shot at them. The police on this show are the single worst shots in history and apparently don't own flash bangs. It's also fascinating to see how a skinny 100 pound girl shoots rifles on full auto, one handed. This show is a cartoon.I can't stand how there are so many pointless ""dramatic"" moments. For example, two of the robbers will say something to each other and then agree ""Let's do it!"" and then rush down the hall and slam open the door where the hostages are, yell loudly and rack their assault rifles and point it at the hostages...and then walk out with a flat screen TV. At other times, they'll walk into the room with the hostages real relaxed with their hands in their pockets and joke with them.Every episode has at least 10 ridiculous scenes with moronic scenarios or terrible acting. The only reason I can imagine this show has a high rating is because I realize that most shows produced outside the US and UK are horrible. So maybe this is actually a good drama by Spanish standards? It has an 8.7 IMDB rating for that reason. Applying US standards, i'd say this show is closer to a 4.5",Money_heist

They could learn a thing or two from shows like 24, Prison Break etc. No thrill whatsoever. It's a very average show. Only people who can find it thrilling are people who aren't familiar to this genre and haven't watched a lot of masterpieces.

897,priyasalvatore,Highly OVERRATED.,4/10,8 August 2020,"It's because of the hype for shows like this, so many good shows remain to not even being discovered by the wider audience.
I started watching this show initially when there wasn't much hype and I barely got through the first season. I mean it's a Heist show for someone who has never watched a Heist concept on screen before.
It just doesn't have what it takes to make good TV. Just a bunch of idiots trying to be smart, shouting at each other with escalating music in the background. THAT DOES NOT MAKE FOR GOOD TV. It's try hard. And only those audiences are easily swayed by these forced instruments in the show, who haven't seen better. It's for rookies.

904,vikasagrawal-98089,Una De Las Mejores Series Que He Visto !!!,10/10,4 April 2020,Money Heist is one of the best series I have ever seen in my entire life. It is so good that it made me write the title of this review in Spanish as a gratitude for creating such a spectacular series for us.A very special gratitude to the director & story writer for having such brains to create such a series. Its actually a chess game experience when you watch the series with Professor playing his turn against whole government and the police and Intelligence and what not AND beating them every single time.Also each and every character has done their best and I have become a big fan of whole crew.I would really recommend this series to each and every person to please watch it and not miss it for the world. It really is a fine piece of art which no one should miss. Best part is it keeps getting better & better every episode and every season beats the previous one.Really hope for the series to not end and eagerly waiting for next season.Impresionante trabajo chicos !!! Felicitaciones !!!,Money_heist
905,femkesratings,PLEASE for the love of God stop continuing finished stories,10/10,7 August 2021,"The first heist (seasons 1 and 2) was absolutely 10/10. After that they completely botchered it. They killed off too many beloved characters and replaced them with characters not nearly as interesting (The Walking Dead had this problem as well). And Raquel, who used to be so well written, gets reduced to nothing more than the Professor's significant other. But mostly the whole story is just not as good and not at all on the same level as the first two seasons. TV executives need to learn when a story is finished and just end series on a high note instead of ruining them for more money.

The actors has done their job in the most astounding way. The show holds a way too different concept then any others it bewildering how the writer wrote it and the way all the cast showed us.Obviously, there were some situations to not like the show but in the end it was astonishing. La casa de papel will always be remembered by me when talking about some breathtaking shows and might even have done the best job on it in some acts. The story line is really good. Watching the first episode will make you fall for the show and will be making you want for more of it.One thing that must be mentioned is the character of Professor. √Ålvaro Morte has done a splendid job for this role. The rapid-fire dialogues were too good. Professor's mind games will make everyone like him. Though I feel like he doing some mistakes in the second heist but after all the ending was too good. The narrator of the show Tokio is also one of the best character. Overtime you will even get wholesome watching the show.It gave me some amazing moments for me to remember which were sad, excitement, breathtaking and delightful.LA CASA DE PAPEL WAS MIND BLOWING AND ONE OF THE BEST!!!!!!",Money_heist

914,drunken_raindrops,Why is Spain copying Hollywood so much lately?,6/10,26 January 2018,"Lately I've been noticing that most of the Spanish cinema that gets out there is very well-filmed, high-budget stuff, but full of obvious cliches and stereotypes. I'm both disappointed and surprised by this.Except from some particular filmmakers like Almodovar or Alex de la Iglesia, I'm not sure how good Spanish cinema used to be before this new hollywoodesque era. It probably wasn't very good anyway. But it still surprises me: why are they recycling formulas that have already been taken to perfection in Hollywood decades ago and are now clearly in decline? Why not try something a bit more brave or original? Do these hollywoodesque manufactures still sell good and that is why they're doing it?Anyway, about this series. It's well-filmed and well-acted. The plot all the time looks like it can get interesting, but it's really just a combination of lots of different Hollywood bank heist movies we've seen before. There are only one or two details here which seem to be original or not borrowed from somewhere else. And these details are not completely bad I must say.But the characters... they are completely stereotyped and it is where this series fails the most. You have the extremely intelligent non-violent group leader who wears glasses and listens to classical music, the computer's guy, the humble welder, and two Russian tough bullies. You even have the very sexy young woman whose specific skill or role within the gang is not clear, besides looking super hot on screen. These are all characters we've seen before a million times. How can people still emphasize with these kinds of characters? However, I thought the acting was pretty good, which saves the characters from total embarrassment.",Money_heist

I'm not a major fan of the main character or her destructive romance and I think it requires a major suspension of belief to imagine anyone pulling this off ,but once you do suspend belief this series carries you along with it and you find yourself hoping they succeed.

923,desdenova,Overhyped and,6/10,8 March 2018,"The series seem to start with a good promise and a thrilling tempo but it never fully develops into something meaningful. The main storyline almost halts solely relying on the tension. The subplots are boring, unrealistic, unoriginal and slows the pace even more. It just swings from an unbelievable and unnecessary topic to another.It obviously tries to extend the airing time with lots of filler moments and sadly filler episodes. This is only good for those who are willing to buy the far fetched plot in exchange for nonsense thrills. This show has very few surprise elements and it revolves around the same topics.Just like the heist story , the TV show goes from awesome to disaster quickly.",Money_heist

925,negar_asadi,Love it,8/10,23 April 2020,"Honestly I can't get these bad reviews though I agree that the show could've eneded just after season 2 but come on!! It's thrilling and exciting to watch! I really don't expect anything else from it. It conveys some important messages about the cruppted system though which is well done.
But I loved some of the actings, the thrill and anticipation.
I watched the whole series while quarantined and it just made it a lot easier.
I watched all episodes back to back and I couldn't stop!
Don't be too serious just enjoy!!

926,poncho-89790,One of the best tv shows of all time!!,10/10,21 August 2019,"So I didn't watch this show because it was in Spanish and knowing that there was still an English version, I didn't think the English version would match up. Let's just say this is by far the most impressive tv show I've ever watched. I compare it to Prison Break, it's that good and that intense! There's so many things that happen, it definitely keeps you guessing and wanting more! I just started season 3 and I can tell you I don't want to stop watching! The things that happen are insane and the Professor is immaculate!

S2 was drama , thriller halfaway and the last 2 episodes was awesome 9/10

I Don't know why U guys say Should Have Stop on S2. This series has a many awards and nominees. They Have To Expand the movie.
If it stops on S2 it will be very short movie
In short word It is an Amazing Action- Packed Thriller Movie

What I Don't Love in S2 is How Much Crazy You Are, How Could Berlin Throw Out Tokyo
That Was The Dumbest Idea Of Whole Series
S3 was good but a copy of S1 the Only Thing That It is different and Better Than S1 was The Final Episode (Astray 9.4) that ended in cliffhangar
Then we got to S4
This Season was for Nairobi and ended up all 6 Episodes was a waste
When Nairobi is Recovering and Ended Up Getting Shot in the head
And Then We Got Terminator so-called Gandhia, I'll Admit that Gandhia Was the best villian of whole Series but they make him like Goddamn superhero
The scene that he shot nairobi in front of 4 robbers in Unrealistic
How Can He Dodge 4 Robbers With 4 Rifles?????And The Thing That I don't Love in the Whole Series is Shooting
It feels Unrealistic",Money_heist
930,shootingstarlucy,"Bigger heist, bigger mistakes",8/10,22 July 2019,"I was worried part 3 wouldn't be as good as parts 1 and 2 however I was happily surprised were the story went, showing how things can fall apart very quickly. The acting is great and the character flaws are realistic and enjoyable to watch, I can't wait for part 4 the only question is will I have any finger nails left due to the nerves of having to wait another year.

932,jaheranny,Mind blowing until the 3rd & 4th season come.,8/10,16 September 2020,"The thrill that produce the first 2 seasons are pieces of sublime. Then average 3rd season came, as it can't compete the 1st two seasons with it's moderate direction. Then the worst one, the fourth season. I think that's the exaggerated bad extension of a well finished series.

Before this show, I was like ""a show can't come near to prison break"" but nope..this one is as great as prison break and maybe even better(for some)...the only flaws is that..their seasons are too short...I finish 1 season in 1 day of binch watching.

938,honeycruller-13318,"Overrated, Overdramatic, Poor cast",2/10,22 May 2020,"I'm surprised to see this show is one of the highly rated. Here's my honest review.
The idea of the story is good
Cons:
Overdramatic: Every episode is 70 to 80% unnecessary time wasting scenes. Director fit forced drama in every sceneWrost Actors: They casted pre-mature actors who you can clearly see that they are not skilled actorsLaugh of a guy called Denver will be the top annoyingEnglish voice over of the professor is so weirdIn 2nd season, inspector will uncover who is the professor, she arrests him but instead of telling anyone in Police or taking him to the station, she takes him to personal spot and make love and do a lie detection test even though he already accepted that he's the one who planned the heist, WTF is this drama man.Conclusion: Avoid brain farts, watch something else.",Money_heist

941,samantajoy-21465,Good but got a lot of melodramatic wastage. Overrated.,7/10,10 April 2020,"I accept that some portions are quite good, thrilling and intriguing but overall it is full of melodrama which will challenge your intellect and logic so hard in some scenes that we will feel to give up.Some seasons are stretched intentionally which leads it to be boring.It is basically a story about a bunch of emotional fools out for world's largest heist and only god knows everytime how their plan is working.
Professor can see the future everytime and the police professionals are like iving on eating grass.
Personally I feel , If it would be more intense clash between two groups,it will be better
Acting is good but not extraordinary.
Cinematography is average
Screenplay should be mentioned as a strong positive point

946,siddharthcv,Ya...okay....,6/10,21 April 2020,"Lacasa De Papel was brilliant in its first 2 seasons....but the 3rd and 4th season seems a bit repetitive, unprofessional and a little bit boring. If you are new to watching tv shows they definitely watch this one as its one of the good shows definitely. It will keep you engaged, its pace is good and it has some commercial(and unprofessional) scenes to please the audience. BUT ! if you have already watched many good tv shows like breaking bad,game of thrones, peaky blinders etc. you definitely wont regret NOT watching this. Especially season 4 made me hate this show as they just dragged to get 8 episodes.
So yeah.....this is a good show, but definitely not even close to other brilliant tv shows

Season 2 was 6/10, too much drama and even more plotholes.
Season 3 was 3/10, the downhill continues and you can understand something has changed. The way the story continues... Logic goes out of the window. They just wanted to make money from an already well known succesful series.
Season 4 is 2/10 more drama and nonsense than anything i have seen. I literally was laughing many times because of how bad the scenario and the scences were...Should have definitely stopped after season 2.

There are a lot of thing that doesn't make sense, the characters suck, writing is terrible and there are too many absurd things. I don't understand how such a show became a cult. I would have given 5 stars for the first two parts but the third and fourth parts are one of the trashest things I've ever seen. If you want to watch it don't take it seriously but watch it as a soap opera because that's what it is.

959,wsknrjdq,What a roller coaster of emotions,5/10,11 March 2021,"The premise was good, overall execution....meh.
The characters are great. I like the way we peek their backstories each episode.
I liked the feel of Oceans 11 with the planning and backup planning elements.
I like that I root for bad guys, then good guys, then bad guys again. That's fun.
Where they lost me is obviously some of the ridiculousness of surgery, having an end,ess supply of artillery, clothing, food and water.
Then in later seasons, the gadgets and tools...I mean did you drive in multiple semi trucks and did the heist team spend years training how to use and do all of these things?
Talk about the Everyman. And everywoman. You get to a point where you can't stop watching because of the high drama but you also want to stop because it's just insulting your intellect. I watched all the way to the end of season 4. The cliffhanger killed me and now I'm dying to watch season five...even though I believe none of it and roll my eyes. Ugh.

All the gun shots and no one got hurt only the ones that were trying not to end others life (robbers were good compare to hostages). The hostages became more evil than the robber. Nairobi did not have to die. They allow (well that how the script is) to be taken by the hostage in a blink of an eye. Not condoning war,killing innocents just be smarter watching their back. Writers made the robbers so stupid.

971,tj_swanson,Painfully Hard To Watch - Totally Overrated,2/10,4 June 2018,"I hate watched this over the last two days. I wanted to watch a fast paced action story that wasn't too deep or dramatic, that I didn't need to think too much about. And it starts off with some promise, but by episode 3, I had to skip parts because they were so bad! As it went on I skipped more and more, mainly the terrible back stories and cliche character development scenes.This should be used as an example of how not to write. Every awful cliche and trope you could think of is contained in this series. It's so over the top, so cheesy, and so very LAME. The worst dialogue ever put down on the page and with so many plot holes. Bad directing, some ok acting, a lot of terrible acting, ok camera work, good soundtrack, but with the worst writing ever. The lead female character is constantly making the most stupid mistakes that threaten the whole plan and she spreads her stupidity to all the other characters. How am I supposed to relate to her and want her to succeed when all she does is make the stupidest screw ups that threaten to derail the whole story?There's also the sexism and chauvinistic garbage littered throughout. ""You made that mistake because you're on your period."" -Actual dialogue! Why are there so many scenes with women in their underwear, sometimes with absolutely no reason why they would be. It's like it was written by a 14 year old boy with no experience with women and all his education from porn. It's possible that the fact I watched it with over dubbed English is responsible for some of its problems. Maybe the Spanish actual dialogue is not so terrible and cheesy.It's also possible that the reason this frustrated me so much is because I believed it could have been a very good show. It had promise. I would love to do a rewrite and make it what I think it could have been. I did actually like the ending - but my god was it painful to get to! The first time I groaned and cursed that I found out there was a part 2 and another horrible 9 episodes to get through until I could finish it.People who rate this 10/10 need their heads examined. It's awful. LAME!",Money_heist

Altho this series starts well, the development of the plot and the characters is disappointing and towards the end it becomes completely unbearable. In the second part nothing makes sense anymore and the show feels like some cheap mexican soap opera where everything can happen. Characters change their minds, hating or loving each other every 5 mins, they do completely ridiculous things for no reason. The police on the other hand just sits there doing nothing.They tried to get in the building 10 times in the first episodes and then in the next 20 they just gossip in a tent. However the best thing is the ending episode. Even a 5 year old kid would have come up with something much more realistic. Such a shame.",Money_heist

992,whartoyo,Melodrama with heist plots,4/10,19 April 2020,"It starts with a good plot, but in season 1 and 2, the pace is so slow, it really feels like the writer is stretching the story too much with drama.
This series could be the best action series of all time, but they choose to bend it to a mini telenovela with overstretched drama.I have to fair, there are great moments, cool actions, chilling plot, but there are also useless conversations, stupid logic and maybe one of the worst: very very unrealistic shooting choreography. Example how can Gandia escape from 6 shooters with assault rifles from a short range?
What happen when the first show down when Palermo hurt his eyes, and nobody else gets a single wound?
You guys should really hire a better choreographer, no need a John Woo level, but a least not this STUPID.The figure Arturo is so cheap, maybe intriguing at first season. But the writer keeps him in season 3 and 4 just to make the audience has someone to hate.
In season 3 and 4, the pace is so much better than the season 1 and 2. But additional to Arturo, here comes Sierra. An unrealistic figure who was created just to made the audience boils.For acting, i have to give Berlin a extra credit for an outstanding performance.
Else from him, i have to say: mostly poor performance. Even the Professor.
Even Tokyo.",Money_heist

Anyway the real problem is that the show could be great but it is heavy flawed and get dumber every passing episode. It is a problem because the plot has a real huge potential.
Basically the plot is based on the very elaborated plan of a mastermind (the professor) to rob a bank... great.... but he choses the worst people for the job (psychopath, hysteric girls etc ...). Eventually it doesn't make any sense.

If you ask in summary of the last two seasons it would be said in a few words and without feeling.

It's the sheer captiveness of the story and smart story telling that puts this show at a whole new pedestal.A simple story broken down to a million pieces of a puzzle, that keeps getting into shape through each episode, is a mark of a brilliant thriller, and this show nails the draft.It keeps the audience hooked, excited and at the edge of curiosity, with each episode, like baiting a fish on to a fishing rod. The actors have delivered a well written piece with complete honesty and commitment, which shines through the series.The twists and turns throughout the story line are engrossing for a binge watch. That rarely is the case nowadays, for a series moving to a 3rd season.If you are fan of good content, which is pacakaged intelligently, to cater to your mind bugs, then this one is a keeper!TV show makers should take a leaf out of this Spanish book of tv series, as this one blows many of them outta park.",Money_heist

1015,deusexum-88538,A perfect example how a show turns into a caricature of itself,3/10,9 December 2021,"They should have stopped with the first heist. Period. Cause the second heist dragged on like snail crossing a highway. What was it supposed to be: an action packed drama or a soap opera spiced with a bit of action? It is the latter for sure. Never mind the overacting that is so typical of Spanish television (before going to take a piss in the toilet, there is an emotional dialogue about whether it is the right thing to do) that just adds the soapy taste to pretty much everything. During the second heist it just became surreal. Got to the point where I was playing with my phone, while the neverending dialogues lasted. Luckily, Najwa Nimri¬¥s character basically singlehandedly saved the show and made it worthwhile to watch. Fernando Cayo¬¥s and Enrique Arce¬¥s characters were just caricatures. Not even funny. Just plain illogical. As I haven¬¥t seen them perform more, can¬¥t say if it was just awful directing or awful acting. Save yourself from watching the second heist. It¬¥s like a bad remake.

1016,Eckleburg,Barely anything redeemable here,2/10,15 May 2018,"Let me first start off by saying that the rating on IMDB is very misrepresentative of the quality of this show. La Casa De Papel is an exercise in poor acting and negligent storytelling; favouring flamboyance and clich√©s above all else. There is a noticeable Fast and Furious influence to the show as the director tries to evoke the same type of camaraderie and attitude amongst the group of outcasts that is the heist operation. It's all for naught however as the characters are shallow due to bad performances and a poor script. Yes, even the acting in the Fast & Furious series can best what is on offer here. Briefly leaving the acting aside, the plot could have been executed with much more cunning and maturity; alas this is not the show where you will find these traits by any stretch. The director seems to have favoured emotional outcomes in most of the decision-making of the characters that detracts from the realism and does a disservice to the supposed calculated effort that a heist of this magnitude should represent. As the scenes roll on with outcomes that aim to be sensational over something more sensible, you lose respect for the show. The lack of talent in screenwriting is further emphasized by the narration done by one of the heist operators that comes and goes throughout the episodes. These passages try to put greater emphasis on how impactful a scene should be yet it nearly has the opposite effect. The cooked up drama of an event in the show for which you have a hard time being emotionally invested in is further disparaging when a voice over is describing what is going on in melodramatic fashion. It's heavy handed, period. There is a lack of professionalism and intelligence from the cast which makes it impossible to take La Casa De Papel seriously.",Money_heist
1017,marcolcn,Overrated too many plot holes,1/10,8 May 2020,"Way too many plot holes no room for creativity. Yes it leaves you on the edge of your seat because you don't know what happens next but it's one of those shows that nothing ever goes wrong in the show. Season 2 is the true finale, got canceled in Spain then Netflix bought it and ruined it. It's like soap opera way too many lo e stories for an action series. They fooled me and don't let them fool you too. So many love scenes, gay scenes, a transexual character which made no sense

This might have worked 10 years ago but now its outdated , So no plans to waste my time on the other 2 seasons.1: To start with the show is very badly acted , characters have unnecessarily loud expressions. The only actor i could see working his role was berlin.2: I am so happy that the police force is not as dumb in real life as it has been shown in the show.3: Creative liberties, the sequences just keep getting more and more stupid and illogical.4: very weak antagonist. Stupid police force and super naive hostages.5: underdeveloped characters , show fails to justify whatever the characters are doing. There are no story arcs or layers to the characters.",Money_heist

1025,bejlicaushi,Very deep and artistic,8/10,16 September 2018,"At first i thought it was another tv show being overrated and it was all about the hype. How wrong i was. At the very first when the Profesor told they were going to enter the Royal Mint, it hit me and then how they were going to be the good guys, robbing no one and becoming the voice of the resistance is totally a masterpiece and creative in an unique way. Loved how they connect with the ""Ciao Bella"", even though many people missed it and are overusing it as just another song and forgetting the message and the history under it. How in each episode everything seems to get worse and then realising it was all planned it left me with my mouth open. And Berlin. The perfect acting and character who sacrificed himself at the end and giving an answer to anyone who thought he was a psychopath. For the first time in my life i feel completed after ending a tv series and not asking myself what i'm going to watch now. And also the use of color red, grey and black, the music on different dramatic scences is a strong point to love it. ""√â questo fiore del partigiano morto per la liberta.""

1026,bejlicaushi,Entertaining action tv show but eventually falls into an exagerated soap opera,8/10,16 November 2020,"The two parts of the first season were really entertaining to watch but after Netflix took over this series it got transformed into a melodrama. Every episode ends with pointless cliffhanger unlike season 1 which ran through more than 10 episodes unlike the Netflix formula, too many confusing turntables, because that's how you can attract more audience but at the cost of quality. It is a perfect example that a great idea and a well written plot can have different outcomes by those in charge of it. I rate it 8 only because of the earliear iconic episodes and the acting of Berlin and the Professor. Loved it.

Was absolutely brilliant in the first few seasons but season 4 is a shambles. I can let a few plot holes slide due to the brilliance of 1-3 but season 4 is so ridiculous that you can't look past the idiotic writing. Very disappointed as seasons 1-3 set the bar high and the writers and direction have failed fans miserably in this latest season... I just hope they get back on track for season 5 or my view of the entire show will be tainted, something I don't want to happen after how much I enjoyed the first 3 seasons!

Sadly, it did not. Not even close! Every single character is irritating in their own unique way. The actual heist is cheesy and child like. The professor is a poor recreation of Prison Breaks michael scholfield and it is obvious to see where they took their inspiration from. I kept on waiting and waiting for the episode to arrive which had me speechless and on the edge of my seat but it just never came. A below average story of a below average heist. Nothing more.

1038,hitesh_dhawan,A.M.A.Z.I.N.G.,10/10,18 September 2020,"Call it communist, call it propaganda but this series delivers a heist we've all longed for.All characters are memorable and the heist feels real. The screenplay is bang on and unfolds each step slow and steady. You wont skip a second.This heist has everything: a legit and believable plan, a legit motive and the Mastermind we never knew we needed .. Professor!Looking forward to season 5!

1040,sraunak-39359,Materialistic heist,6/10,8 May 2020,"Review of season 1 and 2
The professor the mastermind behind this heist just narates from outside to his people inside the bank his plans never fails he has a plan for everything and anything at any given situation which is way too much to handle
The cops are shown dump right throughout the 2 seasons i watched
The heist people just keep on printing money and keep digging the tunnel from the bank to get out the female police inspector finds out about the professor but she also lets her go otherwise the heist content would have been open by now
Overall the web shown is just for entertainment purposes
Otherwise story it has many faults

1041,shettyavi,Best heist series you can bump into,8/10,20 October 2018,"I am very happy that i watched it and i have already recommended it. But the reason i have rated it 8 and not 10 since i ideally think this is a masterpiece keeping in mind the intelligence behind the series. Every detail was figured correctly and the screenplay was apt too. However there are illogical stuffs added which i think takes the charm away but its okay .. they are much avoidable and it doesnt really hamper your exprerience though since its after all cinema so dont apply much brains to a few scenes.
PS - loved the background scores

1045,MBFaller,Exciting but doomed by unbelievability,5/10,5 July 2020,"This was like Oceans 11 meets Die Hard. Lots of cool action. But there were 2 problems: too many unbelievable plot points, like the inspector randomly leaving the site to go out for drinks several times, and too much misogyny. Lots of degradation and abuse of the women characters. Too bad. Could have been great.

1046,cybercipher,Best show since Breaking Bad?,10/10,13 September 2019,"Every now and then a show slaps you in the face and says, ""I'm great! You MUST watch me!"" This is such a show. From the very first episode of season 1 you will be hooked into the intricate, fantastic plotting. The action is fantastic, but as the show grows it is the relationships that give it such ongoing force. Every actor/actress is marvelous. Hard, funny, impulsive, vulnerable in turns. It just grabs you and doesn't let go. I thought that it couldn't get better after season 2 then it DID! Wow. If this had been an American show it would have won dozens of Emmys. Just try it. You'll be glad you did.

Not only had the script already been stretched too far, the writer, hungry for money and popularity, depraved herself of moral standards and produced 3 more toilet paper books. These have faded away forever from the memories of our civilisation and the characters now burn in the timeless incarceration of literary hell. This is the story of La Casa de Papel.

1068,gdevyoussef,Historic Tv-Show,10/10,10 October 2019,"Yes without doubt this tv-show is the best tv-show or movie I ever seen in my life this is a masterpiece for more simplicity I have never felt all these different feelings since I watched another masterpiece movie ""The Godfather"". this tv-show not just about the smartest silly heist like ""Ocean's"" which everything happened good and smoothly without errors. the main idea for ""The Godfather"" and ""La Casa de Papel"" to me is there isn't a pure good or a pure evil but all of humans are good and all of us are bad as an equation changes everyday
Without no doubt I recommend this tv-show if you need to watch a show has more than firing, yelling or silly heist this show is for you

Then it went downhill. I realised that it has A LOT of similarities with Inside Man, a quite good movie. But the characters are plain dumb. The dialogues even dumber. The interactions between robbers and hostages are a joke. It starts off promising and you kind of believe that you are about to watch an uprecedented heist. But it is everything BUT clever. And please, somebody answer an honest question: who is being kept hostage and asks for an abortion pill?? I mean please. Sorry, not worth my time. Cannot imagine what the hype was all about!

1080,ravsbhave,No don't waste your time,3/10,5 April 2020,"I feel this is the most OVERRATED show on Netflix. People are comparing this to BREAKING BAD? Seriously? Damn you're missing a lot...BB was an excellent masterpiece. I enjoyed money heist as well, but it's a 6/10 or maybe 7/10 show it deserves nowhere near 8.5.
The idea of the heist is pretty good I'll give them that No doubt. Till season 2 it was great the casting the plot everything was just impressive. The first few episodes were fascinating and intriguing that's what got me hooked, but it drops after a few episodes. It gets stupid and just more stupid later.
And I see people comparing this to Breaking Bad No Not Even in Lifetime Mate. Those idiots have such bad taste. Money heist is a good one but not exceptional at least don't compare it with the Classic.
This is the kind of OK TV show that a lot of people think is great because haven't seen anything good then this. People who call it a masterpiece, please do understand the difference. It's not even near to becoming a masterpiece. People are just following the trend and don't understand how stupid it gets.

Apart from extra dragging the story line and drab emotions of every character, it performed reasonably well.
But the season 4 put a serious halt into its success.
Just dragged the story without any rich content and ended the season without any result.
Season 4 would put a serious damage to its popularity.

1083,rohitmenonyt,"A well made, intricately designed show that should have ended with season 2",8/10,16 April 2020,"La Casa De Papel or Money Heist was a series which took a couple of episodes initially to grab my interest. Having said that, seasons 1 and 2 (barring a few convenient plot lines) were supremely brilliant. The professor's detailed planning, the execution (along with the things that failed) made it a very interesting show that made viewers aware of the fact that anything is possible in this series & that you're in for a roller coaster ride. It also tied things up neatly (and conveniently, might I add) to give the fans a bittersweet yet strangely satisfactory end to their first 'heist'Alas, with Netflix taking over & with the greed of milking the cash cow, they sort of started ruining the series in seasons 3 and 4. The new characters aren't that interesting (yes Palermo, I'm talking about you), the overuse of Berlin's past to act as a filler in between and also the strange chemistry that the team is now sharing seems very incoherent to what we saw & became used to in the first two seasons. Seasons 3 and 4 aren't terribly bad. They're watchable & they also have their genius moments. It's just that it's too little & something that demands a lot of energy from you to sit through the painfully dramatic scenes (especially in season 4).Even though I'm looking forward to season 5, that's only because I'm way too tied up with the characters now thanks to the first two seasons & also since they left things hanging at the end of season 4.",Money_heist

Professor is also to good but Berlin is the best. I watched this in a single go on two days and whole four seasons get completed. The story is good as plan is beautiful planned by the professor and the situation is always making suspense everytime.

The third season still carries the strength of the recurring characters, as well as introducing Inspector Sierra as a novelty, the debate about the unofficial torture of the State and Helsinki and Nairobi gain more space (showing themselves to be very strong characters). Season 4 (2020) prolongs what should have ended with a longing goodbye.

Have been hearing about this for quite a long time, I started watching it only in 2021 when part 5 was out on Netflix. From Season 1 to Season 5, I watched it in straight 5 days. Fortunately, I didn't ready any user reviews before watching it because I can now see that there are many haters also.I agree there are many unrealistic or illogical scenes but that much freedom is allowed in any TV series or a movie. It is for entertainment and ENTERTAIN it does pretty well. Not for a moment I felt bored or the episode is unworthy.All the actors have been meticulously selected and portrayed.

1102,dead_angel04,Haters gonna hate. Don't listen to them. One of the few series that really deserves all the hype! Just great!,8/10,14 September 2018,"Well yeah. I've seen a couple of terrible reviews here and I really can't understand why. Haters gonna hate I guess. And they're gonna do it out of spite or to show how different or... smart they think they are compared to the rest. Don't listen to them. This show is smart, emotional, with great cinematography and acting... a great production in general. It's still a tv show, right? Are there inconsistencies and errors and ""tv tricks"" to move the plot along? Sure. But does it really matter? Not when a show has that heart. And it's not only the heart or the production. It's the small details, the hidden messages about socialism and society etc. And by the way, the Professor is the most bad-ass nerd ever! And even the characters you hate... you love hating them. This show is definitely the best European tv show I've ever watched and one of the best in general. My only complaint is that I'm not sure there really is a need for one more season, I kinda feel that the story ended the way it should. Nevertheless, great show!

1103,Dramatorium,First storyline is great. The rest pales in comparison.,5/10,10 September 2021,"First season(s) is/are to be considered among the masterpieces of modern TV times. A perfect blend of plot twists derived from classic heist movies/books, along with original, brilliant additions that maintain both its freshness and suspense till the shattering finale. Acting is top notch, script is also flawless, character development pretty much on spot, plus no single flaw can be traced to the very last second.However, when it comes to its Netflix continuation, I do get why many like it, but it seems a bit too stretched in a number of ways. Moments of brilliance are indeed still there, but I can't help but feel they already used most of their best cards for the original seasons. The excessive use of flashbacks, its non-stop-Expendables-shooting-spree, along with the overly dramatic acting makes it very, very blunt for my taste. The Colonel is probably the most irritating character out of all, a person with only two kinds of moods, capable of filling a spot for Space Jam 3 as the superleader of the UltraDorks. A very good actor nevertheless, he only did what he was told, but the more the series progresses the more it turns into a dark-comedy-over-the-top-fiasco.All in all, I get how the series is split in five (or six?) parts, but to me, it's more like Season 1 and Season 2, as it's all about two distinctive storylines. Season One gets 10/10, Season Two maybe 3/10, unless the end proves elusively otherwise. If I had to place a bet though, I would say I expect that nearly everybody dies, in a way a bit too brutal, but their sacrifice won't be in vain as, along with the incoming scandals, an uprising will be inspired for establishing a healthier democracy. Is it going to end up so predictably? I sincerely hope not.",Money_heist

1106,walwrafii,Gets worse and worse,1/10,7 January 2022,"Initially the show is very interesting and intriguing because of how well thought out the robbery is. This robbery and the detailed plan behind it is the main focus of the show and this is the fun part.However, the longer the show goes, the more the robbery falls into second plan and characters and their relations come forward which is not good because the entire show starts to look like a mexican soap opera. It gets very childish.The professor figured out the plan to the finest possible detail, but for some reason decided to hire 10 street idiots to carry it out.The thing becomes super unrealistic, so now you have things like a secretary running around with an automatic rifle hunting down a black ops soldier, one street thug wiping out a military special operations squad or police just casually chilling out in front of banks as they are being robbed for basically entire show and not doing anything about it. These heists wouldn't last 2 hours in the real world.I would recommend watching season one just to give it a go. Any more than that should be a big no.",Money_heist

1112,Mascha88,Flawed but strangely addictive,8/10,2 August 2019,"First of all: if you expect La Casa de Papel to be a well-crafted, logical and consistent story about a money heist, you're going to be sorely disappointed. The inconsistencies and plot are wide enough to drive a truck through. To mention but a few:
Why would anyone even want to have one billion or whatever Euro's in CASH? Wouldn't there be a huge problem with laundering all that money? (This is a recurrent issue in Breaking Bad, for instance, where they're constantly struggling with the problem of what to do with all that cash)How likely is it that the leader of the heist, the 'Professor' gets into a relationship with the lead investigator Raquel Murillo?One might assume that in a hostage situation such as this, the headquarters of the police and investigators would be extremely well-guarded. So why is Raquel so sloppy where access to these headquarters is concerned, letting her boyfriend, i.e. the Professor (okay, she doesn't know yet that he IS the Professor, but one would expect the security to apply to everyone) who actually masterminded the heist and the hostage taking, wander around these headquarters and take a good look at everything and everybody?The scene in which Tokyo vaults back on a motorcycle into the building of the Spanish Mint where the other robbers, while at least twenty policeman are trying to shoot her, is one of the most unlikely I have ever seen.....And I could go on and on.....So, in spite of all these issues, and many, many others, why still the fairly high rating? Well, as I said at the beginning, if you want to see this as a story about a heist, which it purports to be, you're not going to get it. You could say - if you want to look at it in a philosophical way, that this story is really about the human condition. Because after all, what do humans do? They love, they hate, they make love, they try to kill each (and sometimes actually do), they do crazy, stupid, impulsive and irrational things. All this happens at La Casa de Papel. What makes it so convincing is that the actors are, on the whole, excellent. With a few exceptions: I wasn't too crazy about Tokyo, she actually grew more any more annoying as the series went on. Also, the love story between her and Rio didn't really convince me. But almost all the others were great. So real, like people you meet in everyday life. First of all the Professor. Very real, very convincing and consistent. Unworldly and clumsy, but also smart and kind, and driven by an ideal and a vision (no matter how unrealistic). Raquel was convincing too, I thought, as a somewhat stressed-out and overworked woman, and the chemistry between her and the Professor was believable. I also liked Nairobi, great woman, very strong and feisty! And the father-son pair of Denver and Moscow worked well, the affection between them felt real and relatable.
And last but not least: Berlin. Wow. Just wow. At first I thought he was a creep, and then, a psychopath. And then - I just loved him. I have never before seen an actor who was able to display such a range of emotions and characteristics, from viciousness, aggression, arrogance and cynicism to humor, vulnerability, sadness, pain, melancholy and idealism, and make it work. Incredible. And what a pity he won't be around for Season 3 (which I haven't watched yet). On the other hand - given the many unlikely plot twists which went before, maybe they could bring him back? Please? Pleeeaaasse??Anyway, summarizing: my advice when watching this series would be not to worry too much about the plot, but just to sit back and enjoy the ride!",Money_heist
1113,dawidtt-2,Very weak...,3/10,4 July 2020,"I started watching because this show was recommended left and right. The premise looked good enough, but after the S1E2 I found myself skipping the 'romantic' bits. I say romantic, but 'stupid' would be a better word. Countless things in this series don't make any sense. at all. Characters are poorly developed, direction is pretty bad, conversations and motivations are plain weird and nonsensical. At one point the mastermind was having a casual phone conversation with the lead detective while being crushed in a car...
I pulled through until the end of S1, but never again. Avoid!

1114,Movie_Viking,I am shocked by the high ratings of this series,2/10,4 October 2020,"The plot is moving so slowly that watching a coat of paint dry is exiting in direct comparison.The way Netflix has massacred the episodes to make them fit their preferred 45 minute per episode format does not help either. I bet the directors and the writers had some conscious thought about to fit in each episode. However, the ordeal of sitting through all 70 minutes per episode of the original is in no way an attractive proposition either.After one episode I was bored. After two episodes I was wondering what went wrong. Midway through the third episode I just wanted the entire cast to die in an accidental explosion.If you take a moment and read the synopsis for each episode you will soon realize that this does indeed not go anywhere at all.
They have already made 4 seasons of it and are making a 5th season now.",Money_heist
1115,drsavior,"Perfect combination of emotion, thrill and adventure",10/10,8 September 2018,"I will not say much about the plot or the actors, because both were beyond excellent. The chemistry between the actors was unbelievable, and the relationships between the characters were heart-breaking. I was hooked throughout all the episodes due to the incredible plot and its fast pace. As for the finale, it left no loose ends in the plot, but left me in tears. So emotional, so powerful. Sometimes we don't watch shows to have the most accurate depiction of reality, rather than get away from this very reality. La Casa de papel manages to give hope in so many ways. This show is different than anything else. Just watch it already.

Dead NairobiThat's about it, and I made my peace with Nairobi since last season dead, for some reason they decided to bring her back to life to kill her again at the end of this seasonPunch of hugs, cries and completely unnecessary past scenes that were extremely boringGandia standing in the middle of the hallway surrounded by 4 of them shooting automatic weapons and he still stand, breaks out of his cuffs and leave Rio as if he is going to a picnicSo if you look logically at the season, you gained absolutely nothing from 8 episodes, just unnecessary stretch filled with unnecessary events, scenes and past scenesAn idiot decided to help Gandia out the assassin! As if he didnt know how to break out of his cuffs alone! Then he is back in command again! Forgotten and forgiving! Coffin that would stop an assault! A police man that made no sense after jumping off the 4th storey building to agree to join them and giving them all the Intel they need! And a crazy detective who figures it all out from scenes that were put on repeat that she did not see!End of the day.. very disappointing, stretched out and unnecessary season where they could have ended the story there but yet to wait for another season ""maybe""In my opinion they could break lisbon out in the first 2 episodes, had the Gandia drama in 1 episode, dropped the bomb over few different episodes insead of cramping them in 1 and ended the story thereAnd what to expect next season? Another stretched out season to finish a series that could have easily be finished this season",Money_heist

The most popular non-English show on Netflix is back. The 4th part of the show that redefined bank heists with its nerve wracking cat and mouse chases bewteen the mastermind Professor and the Police returns to Netflix amid the global lockdown.
Surprisingly the first few episodes center around the Professor's team lead by Tokyo and Palermo as the Professor comes to terms with the execution of Lisbon in the previous series' finale.
Ego clashes and leadership struggles among the gang mean opportunities for the authorities to gain some foothold into the Bank and these pave way to some surprises both good and bad. A shocking incident galvanizes the gang as the Professor return to the action in the later episodes. From then its the Money Heist action we have become accustomed to with the Professor explaining every small move ahead of execution and executing in impeccable style.The last 2 episodes are a rollercoaster ride leading to yet another Cliffhanger ending. As Netflix pumps more and more money (without having to rob the Central Bank of Spain!) the series is certainly here to stay in Fast and Furious style sans the sexy automobiles.",Money_heist

1122,Gem_Anant,Professor OR Soap Opera Conductor.,1/10,26 April 2020,"Why there is a hype about this sitcom? Professor looks more like soap opera conductor. Too long and boring stories each character. Love and emotions of every character is not required to build the story. I kept the TV on and went to sleep after about 4-5 episodes. When I got up it was 9th episode and the heist plot has not moved an inch. Waste of time.

1123,noumanqaiser,"Nice watch, with some minor flaws in plot",7/10,10 April 2020,"The idea explored by Money Heist wasnt a new one as heists have been a filmed for decades. However Money Heist portays a robbery plan unlike any other interms of depth of planning.The filming has been well caried out and the fact that the series has little violence adds to its value for most audiences. However a few items felt like a flaw in the plot and could have been better thought out to help this season categorize as amongst the best in history.The plot mainly falls short on a few things that sound a bit less logical, the police has far too many resources at hand to deal wih a robbery. In most part of the season professors obsession to pursue relationship with inspector felt unwarranted, especially condiering that it was only ruining some part of this plan every time he met her.The stunt to return tokyo back into mint sound less logical but could be matched with Tokyo's character.Apart from minor flaws in plot the series deserves all appreciation for filming and direction. Berlin and Professor deserve recongition for extra ordinary acting.",Money_heist

1125,lexxes,Great Ride. Must Watch.,10/10,18 September 2018,"Wow! It was such a journey for me. I have been wanting to watch this since the very first trailer came out, but life got in the way and it has to be put off for later. I deeply appreciate that since now I have two seasons and it kept me bingeing all the way to the end. I loved how this is a well thought-out plan and how there are love stories all around. It wasn't too much that it became soapy, but just enough to keep you cheering for the characters. It was so well portrayed that-just like what the Professor wanted them to be-I felt they were real heroes and I really do wish everything ends well for all of them. A part of me hoped they would continue to the running out of the country part and what happen next in all of their lives, but another part can't help but want to leave it all like that so it would never really end. I just thank God and everyone involved that gave us this. It has been an emotional ride, an unforgettable one.

Lots of nonsense, horrible script, soap opera direction and screenplay, an evident necessity to introduce at any cost their left-wing ""progressive"" ideology in economy, gender, violence... which of course ruined any good script they could have before the Netflix executives got involved.First season is great, second good... but don't waste your time with 3 and 4.

1127,ulutasbora,Eh:/,5/10,12 January 2018,"The plot gives us so many promises that it can not keep. Still better than average. However, clich√© characters make it hard to watch wirhout feeling ashamed for the script writer. Some characters are well-built, but mostly stereotypical. It is supposed to be a smart robbery with smart thieves however i cant stop wondering why the proffesor picked those people specifically. Tokyo, for example, what is she really good for except supposed-to-be-sexy clich√© monologues to intimidate certain someone or just wandering around, turning people on, making it all harder for the others.
There are many flaws as such.
But still watching it for the fun of it since it is hard to find clever scripts anymore.
The show is thrilling enough to let myself be fooled on certain details.

1137,arturszakss,"Heist story overstuffed with unnecessary love stories, emotions and feelings...",5/10,11 September 2020,"Although in overall as a show, i liked it, but in many moments i wanted to facepalm so much...
Police was showed totally incompetent. While Main investigator should have stayed at the scene and investigate it, she went to deal with her personal life and personal problems. Like she couldn't waited few days- totally unprofessional.
Even after just 3 days she was falling in love with total stranger. Throwing her child and her life and everything else for him.Film makers focused more on love story and relationships more than the heist itself. Sometimes it was even forgetable that heist is happening, because robbers was leaving hostages alone, and hostages didn't tried to do anything to escape (they had so many opportunities to escape), even one falled in love with the robber. I would like to say that's not how things happen in real life.Incompetent police which doesn't know how to shoot, and spending more bullets than they have in magazines, never reloading.And i also think it should have ended with season 2, because the rest is almost the same only in bank of spain, blackmailing goverment to release one of his guys.
Hostages don't think for themselves - they are ordered to put on masks with fake weapons go outside - c'mon that's obvious why they order to do that, just don't do it, take off the mask, throw fake weapons away and run away, but no, those sheep do what ever they are told like they support the robbersand don't care about thir own lives...Why in the 3rd and 4th season there is pregnant police investigator? She shouldn't be there at all. No matter how good she is.
Why did snipers didn't shoot Tokyo and Rio when they opened the door to destory the armored car?It got more interesting when Gandia started to hunt all of them.I don't know maybe it's because i rooted for police all the time, but as i said sometimes it was hard for me to watch this show because of so unlogical it is. :DAnd so many unnecessary feelings and emotions - like they really can't wait to ressolve those after the heist...So i read that there will be a season 5...",Money_heist

1147,rohansivon,"Don't understand the high ratings. Just a Popcorn, potboiler stuff. Nothing above the ordinary..",6/10,17 March 2020,"Definitely not a 8.5
It's good in places, but unrealistic and drag almost all the way, except the last two episodes of season 2. I don't understand a sudden rush at the end with dumb plots. Unwanted love interests, which is cringeworthy. Just wanted to finish watching it.I mean you'll love it as a potboiler, popcorn series, but if you are looking for excellence, intriguing series, this is not the one.

However the producers decided to be greedy and milk all the integrity out of the series. I have managed to plough through season 3 and 4 . I will definitely not be subjecting myself to anymore of this gratuitous and pointless drivel.

1149,thenobbyworks,Thumbs up Season 1; Thumbs down Season 2,5/10,15 April 2018,"Eight stars for Season One, which was a nice, taut heist series with interesting twists and characters. One star for Season Two...a bridge way too far. A well done cops and robbers caper turned into a superficial Robin Hood Oceans 11mash-up. A worthy theme of female empowerment turned into insulting women stupid in love. A page-turner turned into an excruciating series of farcical plot twists and character reversals all in service of filling out a second season of unnecessary and unbelievable drama. Like a Thanksgiving dinner...the first serving is delicious and satisfying; the second full of regret and shame.

1152,madison-martin,Oh my god. What a show!! *spoilers*,10/10,28 September 2020,"I don't even know where to start!
premise unlike anything on tvamazing characters..all unique, all so complex. We get to watch each ones character development.the acting.. I can't say anything bad about any of them. I also can't narrow down who the best is. I have to say the emotions that the actors can portray floors me every time. You don't often see many men crying hysterically on tv and believe it...the script is suspenseful.. never once did I know what would happen next.they can do it all perfectly ..the thrilling robbery scenes, romance scenes, sad death scenes etc. All as intense as the next.I will say I'm glad it's ending after one more season because I hate seeing shows overrun their course with no more ideas or good characters.
Also should mention I watched it dubbed English. When I noticed I was picking a show with dubs I was initially turned off but I stopped noticing 10 mins in with all that's going on!!Fav character: Nairobi, Denver
Best moment: the escape from the mint",Money_heist

1158,ozgur-celik,Not worth your time,2/10,27 March 2018,"The show starts with an interesting plot but then I found it unbearable to watch even after the 2-3 episode.
These characters were chosen for this mission because they were good at what they do and that the whole plan should go swiftly. In addition they prepared for months for this heist. However nearly all decisions are made stupidly and for no good reason. How come there is an affair for months among these 'clever' people, staying in the same house all together. 
Weren't they expecting some reaction from the hostages? Why try to execute the woman immediately after the incident and why didn't Berlin gave the mission to one of the muscle boys and started a family drama? (Weren't Berlin the one with good social skills.) And how can you even beat one of your own 'gang' members after a mistake; aren't they all supposed to be equals? The gang could be in fact clever but could had problems because the police chef is also clever or few of the hostages were witty to alternate their initial plans. 
I can go on more but in summary, I think the show doesn't deliver what it is promising. The only reason I am writing this review is the fact that it has 8.8 on IMDb and it is in my opinion overrated.",Money_heist

1160,gpinkedi,This show made me realize so many things,10/10,13 September 2021,"I don't know why so many people said that after season 2 it get's bad. It is really hard to keep a tv show alive, bc u always need to come up with new things, and to make it more and more interesting. From the first episode (season 3) you can see how much it means to have a big budget. I think it's fantastic what they did, and i'm grateful to netflix for buying the show.I really loved how they combined the action with the love stories, the sad parts with the funny moments. The script is really smart, you can see how much they prepared to make it as relistic as they could. Of course, sometimes it's a bit exagerated, like when Ghandia is a like a terminator, but if everything would be realistic, the fights would be over in 5 seconds. The cast is really good, they created so complex characters, the professors character is amazingly well executed.This is the best show i've ever seen.

It's a brilliant show, an absolute gem, might be my favorite tv series ever (matter of taste, obviously).Intelligent cat & mouse game with tons of twists and excellent characters. You have no idea what will happen, it's full of suspense and chances are you won't be able to stop watching.I watched 10 episodes on Netflix in one night, which didn't happen to me since the first season of Prison Break (with which this show is very similar).PS (for those who didn't watch it all): There are 15 episodes of 70 minutes each. Netflix took the first 9 and transformed them into 13 shorter episodes for Part One. So there are actually six more 70 minute episodes left for Part Two. Hopefully it catches a wide audience and we will get to see more of this.",Money_heist

Character build is lame and unreal. Definitely one of the most overrated series. But still good watch.

Oh my, the sex.. it seems like that's a real dealbreaker too and that folks are actually bummed out when producers decide to fill in some parts of the series with some mindless sexy stuff instead of adding more violence, blood and at least 10 kills per episode?Also yes, Europeans are generally pretty voiced people. If we aren't content, we speak up.So to be entirely honest here, no, i don't feel as if using the movie industry to put crooked business people and politicians or bad killer-cops in a more negative daylight is a bad thing.It's not like this happens all the time in film, or as if it's a lie..I mean give me a break, could you all try to not compare every damn piece of film ever made to those same old Hollywood stuff? Or to how it would be as if it was shot in the USA to begin with and just enjoy things that are set in and around other cultures, as they are?The show is lovely in Spanish because Spanish is a beautiful language. (Oh and it is the second most spoken language in America! ;)) and I'm sure dubbing it takes out so much nuance, humour, wit, originality and ease, you might aswell not watch it at all.",Money_heist

1177,sheilapoul,Good but not the best,8/10,12 April 2020,"I watched it after too many hype, I was a little prejudicial at first, but later I understood the hype but it lasted for only 2 seasons. The actors and the musics are one of the best things. In general the first 2 seasons are brilliant and well- thought but the 3rd and 4th seasons are just for the hype. I think it should've ended at the end of the 2nd season but It is definetely worth to watch (especially for the actors/actresses and the music) . I recommend it but don't take your hopes too high for the rest of the series after the first two.

1179,brinberlin,The second half is terrible,5/10,1 August 2020,"The first two series: fine. The third, so-so. The fourth, absurd. At its best it's a comic book with fine plot twists and turns. But increasingly, most of the characters are caricatures; macho men, stupid beyond belief. Women at the prey of their womanly emotions. Anyone will betray anyone for a bit of lurve. They scream incessantly at each other. Most of them couldn't rob a bad script of its defaults. Really, really disappointing. The worst is the cod philosophy they tell each other, and us, all the blooming time, about life, love, human nature... it would take a heart of stone not to laugh at these 'serious' bits.

It is a jaw dropping, literal heart stopping show that makes you fall in love with each character, despite knowing that the show could kill them at any point in time. This is a classic robbery show twisted, where the robbers are the 'good guys' and the police are the bad ones. The acting is amazing, and being set in Spain this show is ever more gorgeous. I just don't know what to say. Watch it. That's all. Just watch it.

As the series was progressing towards the 3rd season( which should have never existed) you keep on realising that it's going the ARROW & FLASH way. It takes its audience granted as idiots and without any doubt those rating it 10 are either in their teenage or haven't really seen any great stuff. It's a torture which is difficult to bear. I'm rating it 5 overall and for the first two season's my rating is 8 . Rest season's gets dumb and dumber as they progress.

It is really hard to keep a tv show alive, bc u always need to come up with new things, and to make it more and more interesting. From the first episode (season 3) you can see how much it means to have a big budget. I think it's fantastic what they did, and i'm grateful to netflix for buying the show.I really loved how they combined the action with the love stories, the sad parts with the funny moments. The script is really smart, you can see how much they prepared to make it as realistic as they could. Of course, sometimes it's a bit exagerated, like when Gandia is a like a terminator, but if everything would be realistic, the fights would be over in 5 seconds. The cast is really good, I think is fascinating how they create actually negativ characters, and you somehow resonate with them, and you get to addicted to them. The professors character is wow, just wow.This is the best show i've ever seen. I watched it twice alredy, and i can't get enough :>Well done!",Money_heist

Trivial as a plot, nothing unexpected. There are many illogical things, some mistakes in the interpretation of the actors (maybe due to the script or the director).
The only thing I liked was the scenography.

The mind games in the first two seasons were so brilliant, the background music made the scenes very intense and thrilling and I felt like we engaged with the characters a lot. We all loved Berlin.But then, the third season was like a transition from very good in the first two seasons to very bad in the fourth.In the fourth and half of the fifth seasons, the show was so frustrating to the point where I kept checking how long until this ends. The second half of the fifth season was alright but I didn't like the ending.So, I really loved the first two seasons and it was one of my favorite shows, but then it had a free fall.",Money_heist

Things started to be little silly and more fiction, just like an Indian movie, and even more!!

The SWAT police are really lousy shots, as well.The ending isn't really up to par either.How could the police miss the truck leaving the garage and did the police just drop the investigation in the end, not following up on the leads or watching video, etc, etc..? How they got away and what happened to everyone else is not mentioned. Ridiculous ending.",Money_heist

However the following seasons are not, the music is wrong, the story doesn't make sense, there are gunfights and useless standoffs in almost every episode and all of this leads us nowhere but makes us miss dearly the first two seasons.I have to rate this a 9, S1 and S2 are actually a 10 but the following seasons are a very big letdown.

You'll get addicted to the show and you'll start admiring some characters while hating the others. Seriously I got so much involved in the show that I started cursing some of the characters.

Me not having any experience at all in robbing a bank see some stuff happen in the show I know would be stupid and mess up the job. You would expect a little better from 'professionals'.

1232,gamestvbobbi,"Good storyline, okay Characters",6/10,27 April 2020,"So this started off interesting and with huge potential. The storyline is really good, but the characters... some of the characters are just painful to watch.
The conflicts between them and their emotions are well written and that is fun to watch.The antagonists (police) are kind of emotionless and that makes the viewers take the side of the protagonists without even looking into what the antagonists are driven by because it isn't there. Okay you may be saying ""it's the police and that's their job"", and you're right, it is their job but that doesn't make an excuse for not giving them a better reason than just following orders.In my opinion all the seasons so far have been interesting to watch but I feel like there is still something missing.

1234,guit_911,Reminds me of how good Prison Break season 1 was,9/10,26 February 2018,"The writing on this is incredible, every episode ends with something awesome and makes you want to watch the next one. That's how you write a serie the right way. Rolls out just like the best series Hollywood ever made.The emotions are felt throughout and backed with a strong soundtrack (even more in part 2 with some traits of Interstellar thrown in the mix).Only negatives I found which is why I give it a 9 , is that the second part is 6 episodes and the end as good as it is, is rushed a lot. They could have done a 7th episode easily. Also , there is almost zero characted background in the serie except in episode 1 . Finally, a certain hostage which you would think would be a key hostage for the whole serie , become pretty much useless after the first half of part 1.However, the serie have so much positives, that I just thought about these at the end of all of it with a huge smile on my face",Money_heist
1235,rolweinrw,Stop after the fist two seasons,5/10,6 December 2021,"The end of the last season makes no sense. They still could take the whole country as a hostage, because they still got the gold. Why should a country let them get away with it, even if they could set them under pressure in the future. Sometimes a happy end isn't the best end. The last season felt like fast and furious...",Money_heist
1236,sreyam_das,This is a true masterpiece.,9/10,4 May 2020,"Money Heist is an EMOTION. Best ever series watched so far of such concept. Marvel fans, saying this would not be an injustice, that Money Heist has been capable of building the characters to the same extent over time. Today, I can feel the characters, the kind of directions that has been given makes this series ever lasting. Special Kudos to the whole team of writers, director producers everyone who believed in Money Heist.I bet you in coming time if this series goes on n on soon they will build their characters to such an extent that it would be a benchmark in itself.Kudos to Berlin, aka Pedro Alonso, best character of the series, with perfect attitude, mannerisms, professionalism, brilliant acting and speech with perfect choice of words.Professor, he is an undefeated legend (GAMA), No words to explain the character that has been played beautifully. Saying anything about professor is not possible. Frankly, I am not capable of writing something about professor in few words, coz words cannot do justice to his character. Above than judgement. Director has done a great job in perfectly selecting the crew and giving the characters what was required.Nairobi wow, what a dialogue delivery you have .
Denver Moscow Helsinki, apt for the role.
Monica you took my heart when you picked up the gun for your friendsTamayo, Alicia Sierra, brilliantly played the role, Arturo was absolute pain, very well portrayed as n irritating character. Over all each n every performance, concept, story, thrills, brains, dialogues, beautiful happy moments, all this makes Money Heist, The most trending series in India. This will be remembered forever. Every character is an emotion and is a life.Only Con of this series is the re-involvement of the character Arturo Roman in the 2nd heist. This entry makes no sense in the entire series.",Money_heist
1237,tilak-22911,#MAR ACTIVITY #MAKAUT #TVSERIESREVIEW #ONETIMEWAtch,8/10,9 May 2020,"MONEY HEIST (known in Spanish as La casa de papel) is a Spanish crime drama featuring a group of misfit thieves attempting to rob the Royal Mint of Spain. When a young woman (√örsula Corber√≥) loses her partner after a failed bank robbery, she is recruited by a man known only as The Professor (√Ålvaro Morte) to join a group of misfit criminals who have nothing to lose by participating in a major heist. Now known by the code name Tokio, she joins jewel thief Berlin (Pedro Alonso), check forger Nairobi (Alba Flores), a young hacker known as Rio (Miguel Herr√°n), father-son team Mosc√∫ (Pace Tous) and Denver (Jaime Lorente), and cousins Oslo (Roberto Garc√≠a Ruiz) and Helsinki (Darko Peric), two former Serbian soldiers, in devising a system for taking over the Spanish Mint in order to print out, and escaping with, over two billion Euro. Now, five months later, the group carries out its task. But despite The Professor's strict rules and clearly researched plans, things aren't going as expected. Throughout it all, some of what transpired during the five months of preparation is revealed. Meanwhile, the personal stories of some of the members, hostages, and law enforcement begin to intertwine and get complicated.This crime drama offers a complex story world that combines components of the traditional bank heist plot line with action sequences and elements of the surreal. Because the series was originally produced as a two-part limited series, the main cast is given the time to evolve into multidimensional characters, which makes them worth investing in. Furthermore, despite the fact that key events are often narrated by Tokio, a range of individual stories are woven together in unexpected ways, broadening the point of view. But despite streaming in shorter installments (and the reliance on subtitles for non-Spanish speaking viewers),Money Heist remains a skillfully crafted, engaging adult-oriented tale that is worth the watch. If one loves seeing english stuffs this really going to make him better on the quarantine days.",Money_heist

1239,dsmoniz-40851,We thoroughly enjoyed it.,7/10,14 May 2020,"Even though this is a dubbed series, we were totally wrapped up into it, It is good concept of a heist but like some people are saying it does get carried away and it should have finished after a few season. Over all the thought was good, but the officer getting involved and falling in love with the mastermind was taken too far and other issues also along the way that were taken too far.",Money_heist
1240,tedina-96875,Completely overrated - I think people might like this show cause there's not much else to do during the pandemic,4/10,26 February 2021,"I started watching because so many people recommended this show to me and the ratings were so good. The only good thing about this show is the original idea of the robbery. Otherwise it's many many episodes where barely anything happens, it' extremely boring and super annoying with the plot not making any sense, the characters making stupid, rooky mistakes after preparing for months and so much unnecessary drama and stupid dialogues. If the overall rating would've been between 6 or 7, I would think that's acceptable. But in comparison to all the hype, it's garbage.

1241,ravichilka,UNDERRATED upto season 2 and OVERRATTED after season 3,8/10,29 June 2020,As the title suggest this series starts with an Agenda of biggest Heist in world. Season one gives us best thriller experience and season 2 will surpass all the expectation finishing the story in most extraordinary manner.Biggest Mistake is after the great execution of first 2 seasons there was script development just for the sake of profits.Season 3 as expected slows down the pace and makes it merely a thriller and ends in a cliffhanger.Season 4 finishes well but at this point of time we will realize the season 3 and 4 are mistakes.VERDIT- Good series but could have become Magnificent if ended at season 2.,Money_heist

1243,sohailkulkarni,Almost close to a masterpiece!!,9/10,19 July 2020,"It's totally worth the hype till season 2, post which the series takes a bizzare and logically abrupt turn with a series of amateur events that take place.Let's agree it's show much more than just HIEST, its an amalgamation of all aspects be friendship, humanity, intelligence and he'll yeah the whole government system as whole !Season 1 and 2 are definately masterpiece, there aren't many hits from a few like breaking bad, GOT, DARK and a few more
Rating itself in Netflix's top shows is understandable but one of the greatest shows in history is utterly disgustingAll said and done, I presumbly felt that it should have ended in the second season.
Although there are few big HITS in the show such as
How meticulously each and every plot is depicted with some penultimate action sequences, also the bonding shown between the mates is intact throughout the show with the professor stealing the show every freaking time.
Ofcourse everyone is awestruck by the heavy bombings and how most of the times they deal with it in due diligence.Might not be the greatest show out there but surely one which you should binge watch this year!!",Money_heist
1244,praveenmarella,Paper Thin Economy,9/10,13 April 2018,"This series gave me the same kind of KICK that Narcos gave...except for some dragging movements which can be skipped. Few parts were boring like the planning of hostages to escape which can be avoided by fast forwarding. But overall a Good Series. One more series which helps us to understand how the Economy is Paper Thin.

I just want to point out why I don't agree with them. I have rated the series with a 5/10. That's because I thought the first season was pretty good. Good story and really exciting. Apart from the dialogues and partly very flat drawn characters. Unfortunately, even here it was already apparent in which direction it goes. Soap opera. In addition, the story dragged on so long that I had to skip almost entire episodes at the end, so as not to get bored. I still started to watch the second season. Only after a few episodes I realized that the problems of the first season had even worsened. Unfortunately, once again a lot of potential was wasted. Because of the effort, I give it 5/10, even though I haven't seen the third and fourth season.

1268,Eneser66,The ida is good but too long,7/10,1 November 2021,"It feels like the show would be a good masterpiece if they would end it earlier. They print money, end the heist and it's over, right? Not to give spoilers but after the first heist, some things happen to extend the show with more seasons that makes the content not enjoyable anymore. I personally got bored but overall still enjoyed the first part, so a valid 7/10 should be fair.

It is as if they couldn't make a choice which genre to take and ended up with a bit of... I don't know what they ended up with.

If you follow it carefully you will be able to find simple equation that won't match. That is the amount of things they have inside minus the things they brought in. Somebody please tell me for God's sake, there did they find those welding machines, tanks, masks, suits, guns, more ammo, cigarettes, scuba stuff. Let alone the dummy guns.. And besides stuffing all somewhere those 100 people including hostages do not eat and drink hopefully..
It is fun to watch if you fast forward some of the most idiotic dialogues ever. Why do they even argue all the time?! One final thing. Agent Sierra should be all cut out because of her ""I think I act very well but I am a disgrace joker which does not even exist in circus"" behaviour.",Money_heist

It's like the writers were given Season 4 and 5 as the final chance to pour in every bit of character building, plot development and a tonne of thrills to end on an unexpected and a strong end.If you haven't given 'Casa de Papel' / 'Money Heist' a shot yet, now's a damn fine time to do so.

With its unpredictable and overwhelming plot, this series so addictive that one will definitely complete it in binge watch. The series revolves around a very strong, mysterious, genius yet very kind man name Sergio Martinez(The Professor) who spends half of his life planning the biggest robbery in the history with a very dangerous but capable crew. Despite facing all the problems in the way he and his crew somehow able to get away with around 1 billion euros in cash without leaving any trail.
Talking about the cinematography of the series, it looks very cool. I mean the producer Alex Pina and team has done a really good job creating a tense environment which suits the storyline of the series. All the actors have done a fine job with their characters. No doubt about that. The series is mostly shot in Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) headquarters(called as The Royal Mint in the series.)
In my opinion, if you love watching crime movies and series, then you should not skip this one. No way! This is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SERIES.Thank you!",Money_heist

Again and again.The bankrobbers are the most incompetent, irrational, emotion driven bunch I've ever seen.
The professor is supposedly super smart, but actually reminds me of one of those people who are convinced themselves they are smart, but everybody else knows they're not.At some point I wanted to punch basically every character in the face when they were stupid or emotional again. Completely unlikeable characters.Good for some brainless binging, but keep your finger near the ffwd button or play some games or smth.I feel really bad for the script writers.

1295,usafa93,A disciplined course of viewing,2/10,31 May 2018,"2 Stars because I found two of the characters likable. Both of them played the role of criminal. One was like a ""Gus"" from Breaking Bad. The criminal mastermind. The other, the most likable, was a narcissistic sociopath. He is described as having no empathy, but you, the viewer, will realize he's the only sane being in a world gone mad. You will feel his pain, i.e. you will empathize with the sociopath. Every other character was pathetic and hackneyed, and completely inconsistent. 
 This gang of fools would change allegiances and principles on a dime, just to add discourse and plot twists. This made for frustrating viewing. The writers are not your friends. I did finish the series to see how my two anti-heroes made out. Although, for the final 5 episodes I only watched about 5 out of 45 minutes each, just to advance the plot.This is more than a review, this is a ""self help"" posting.
If you are really curious, and you want to give it a chance, here is my recommended execution:1. Watch the first 4 episodes entirely. You will know the plot and all the characters. 
2. Spend about 15 minutes, each, on the following 3 episodes. At that point, you'll be ready for step #3.
2. Completely skip the next 14 episodes. The same things happen over and over again. Don't put yourself through it. 
3. For the grand finale, watch the last 15 minutes.",Money_heist
1296,aliahmadi72,"Do yourself a favor, don't watch season 3, 4 and 5",7/10,7 September 2021,"La casa de papel started as a promising bold show. The first and second season had amusing and strong plot. Well defined characters and a storyline that could certainly catch your attention. The duel and chess between the protagonist and antagonist was surprising and full of ups and downs. Of course there were plot holes but you could overlook them in favor of the overall strength of story. The whole idea was bold and well developed, all and all, the ending was satisfying and well-written too.But then came the third, forth and fifth seasons. The ones that Netflix actually created. The strong amazing plot turned into a cheesy foolish joke which was written by a class of third graders, and the smart kids weren't in the class!!What a shame. There are so many problems with these seasons that I don't know where to even begin. Unnecessary flood of new characters whom you cannot relate to at all. The plot which was filled with surprises became totally predictable and utterly boring. You can watch a trick pulled again and again until it becomes a total cliche, but even then the writers won't let the worn out trick go away. Romance subplots are awful in these seasons. There are so many plot holes that you would wonder is it even possible to fit in any more? And as the plot gets more boring And flawed, writers just pour more gunfights into the story in hope of saving it, but it's a futile attempt, the gun fights are even worse than a bunch of stormtroopers trying to aim straight!So please do your self a favor. Grab some popcorn, watch the first two seasons, but then forget that the rest of the show was produced. Save yourself a good memory of a great amusing TV series, which was ruined for us by watching the last three seasons.",Money_heist
1297,Rhaevon,Best series ever,8/10,6 March 2018,"I started watching this show because a lot of my friends told me to do it. I was curious about all the hype, so I gave it a try. From the first episode I just couldn't keep away from it. The plot is amazingly good. Of course it's not something that has never been done before, but I believe it has never been done with this kind of quality.Acting is on point, characters are unique and you can really connect with them, feel pity for them, hate/love them.Of course this is all subjective but I can't really understand how someone can give a 1/10 or 2/10 to these series. For me this is the best series I have ever seen. You should definitely give a try and see for yourself

1301,idan22moral,Even the most amazing plan has flaws,8/10,26 May 2020,"* CONTAINS SPOILERS *First of all, I'll start by saying that this is not a bad show at all. Actually, this might be one of the most interesting European shows that I've watched. I had a really good time watching it, in fact, I binge-watched it in around 4 days.
I feel like my duty is not to show how good the show is, but to note what are the flaws that could be improved. Consider this review a future-reference for the successor of Money Heist.The show follows the story of a gang of robbers (I'm over simplifying), who are lead by The Professor. As soon as you see him for the first time, you understand that his character is different from the others. The name, the behavior, the look - they're all different. Fast forward in the show, we understand that The Professor is not that social, and has no experience with women.
Another fast forward - The Professor falls in love with the Inspector, Raquel. As I see things, the evolution in The Professor's character was not bold when it comes to relationships, and √Ålvaro Morte's acting was convincing enough in that part. I think the problem lays in the scripts and not the acting. At some point in a show, the character should be as different as possible from it's original state, especially when the evolution takes place in the love playground.
So - I believe that if Sergio's love for Raquel was pushed to the limits, the emotional roller coaster in the show was much stronger (and better).As I already said, the problem lays in the scripts. The show is FULL of swears, and without thinking about it too much I can say that at least 95% of the swears in the show take the son-of-a-female-dog form. I'm no expert, but from what I know the Latin vocabulary is loaded with much more interesting and joyful swears. We can see the same laziness (sorry to say it that way, but it feels like laziness) in crucial points of the story. The first example that comes to my mind is the ""For Nairobi!"" scene at the end of the 4th season. That scene is the end of a very important part of the story, and the only thing that all the robbers say one after the other is this phrase.
Different solution? let one character say it with heavy emotion, then cut the scene as you did perfectly (truly, awesome cut) at the end of the episode. There's no need to add Avengers-Endgame vibe to a scene so emotional.Another thing that bothers me is the low emotional strength of Raquel, and a lot of other characters too. As far as I know, police officers are trained to handle intense emotional stress while being on-duty, therefore they can handle insults and truth being told to their face without losing the poker-face. So, I was disappointed to see the characters (especially the cops) breaking so easily that many times in the show.
Next time - build the character's emotional baggage and let it explode in some point later in the story.Lastly, a lot of times shows are being criticized by professionals for missing technological details, or even simple things like geographical details. I'll not get into that to much, because making things up is a fine solution in some cases, but some things are unforgivable. Nairobi was shot by a SNIPER rifle near the HEART, and she survived the shot. I'm not a military expert, and I was never shot by anything, but I know for sure that this is physically impossible. The thing that sets me off is that the solution was to switch the sniper rifle with an assault rifle, and that's it, no other costs in production, just add more accuracy and realism to the scene.After almost butchering the show for the small details, I'll say that the heist plans were magnificent and the overall cinematography was truly attention-drawing. The soundtrack was awesome! Choosing between continuing to the next episode or listening to the episode-concluding song was really difficult.Rating it 8/10.
Ciao.",Money_heist

1304,Zebra7,Enjoyable thriller,6/10,26 December 2017,"The series definitely kept me entertained though I had to suspend my disbelief in some parts to keep on watching as the plot relies heavily on ""luck"" and some of the characters' disposition or willingness to put emotion over logic/reason. Even the Police were too emotional when they were supposed to be level headed. Some may call that ""being human"" and this may actually have something to do with the Spanish culture which I am not that familiar with, so possibly didn't get to appreciate, but rather found it annoying. Having said that, all the characters are likable and it is a good solid drama that will keep you guessing in some parts.",Money_heist
1305,cks1900,Addictive,8/10,22 January 2018,"Just watched tonight at the end of this Spanish production, which had a priority in my list since it began to be broadcast on TV in Spain, the final conclusion is that it was really very good.The first episode captures us, holds us in this game of chess that begins soon by promising so much, with this will endure a 2 or 3 episodes that follow without the same adrenaline and perfection, until we conquer again and arrest us again inside the paper house.
Until the end.I could understand the little frustration you can feel because either in the script, or in the work and interpretation of one or another character the thing has not been at the level it deserved, what could take this production to almost perfection, but we can¬¥t focus on the failures or defects of something so good.So many entrancing characters, a plot full of drama and vibrant adrenaline, very well crafted.Always with great suspense.The best that has been seen in recent years, whether in movies or TV series, has come from various latitudes but less and less from Hollywood.the eclipse of Hollywood allows more and more people to realize this quality and open their horizons, it¬¥s the positive sign to withdraw, to see more and more people seeing high quality productions from other countries, continents and languages.Final note, an eight that could well have reached nine or even ten, because there was so much potential for that.",Money_heist

1st season was new, amazing and innovative! It surfed above the global trend of ""socialism"" and normal people fighting against oppression... everyone loved it, actors etc... was translated everywhere and the became a phenomen with Dali's masks (symbol of Anonymous too)...
Ok during 1st season, all this was quite balanced and exciting.
Season 2, we end the topic quite properly... a bit Amercian though...Then starts the tragedy... Netflix decides we can do more... not house of money, but Banco de Espa√±a... Gold this time... well...
That's when everything becomes too much, Police become the very very bad guys, all political, abusive and very much oriented to current government in Spain... about social rights, Women's rights, men are violent, the team of Money heist becomes the victims almost, etc... even when nonsense in current context.

Seems the opposite of many netflix shows that they cancel after 2 seasons for no reason... this has continued for too long.I would give the first 2 seasons like an 8 or a 10, now its 6 topsI'm actually typing this watching the last season and its such a chore to get through.I don't find these characters heroic, I don''t even care now if they live or die. All I wanted to see is how they would pull of this heist.

1322,Anshuman786,This Spanish Netflix Series is there to keep you hooked till the end,10/10,17 November 2018,"Recently I got addicted to this series and with its well thought out, brilliantly designed script and the way proper space it gave to each character cast to crawl out of the woodwork and define themselves, it was totally worth it. Despite being a high octane drama it sneaks past the barrier of your heart and sparks the dormant set of emotions which were lying around yearning to be recognised again. This is perhaps the only of its kind heist thriller which proudly defines its own standards and redefines the whole Netflix game in a new light ,while keeping the audience glued to their TV sets.
Alvaro Morte has so flawlessly blended into the character of ""Professor"" in this drama that it would be hard to differentiate acting from reality at times, whereas Raquel Murillo (Itziar Ituno) is an excellent actress who captures the soul of the character she played. (I had to google to know her name though but would remember now). The crazy pace this series maintains would simply boggle your mind and make you crave for more. Though reading the subtitles might make you miss the minute acts but maybe I might watch it again for this is a perfect feast in a sapiosexual manner.",Money_heist

1324,jaguar-1947,Stop Justifying Crime & Tokyo is pathetic character,1/10,23 April 2020,"First of all, we should stop celebrating a crime.
The professor & his team is nothing but a group of criminals. By loving the series, we are encouraging crime. If not, then tomorrow they will make series on terrorists and show them as warriors of Resistance.About series, I think Tokyo is a pathetic character who is so selfish that while other gang members risk their lives for her, she always mess up the operation. She tries to look powerful but she is not. She is unstable and week.
The makers should remove her from series.I would love to see all them getting caught or killed in Season 5 and Police should win, because we love our country and our police. Not the criminals.Right fellas?

1326,BingeAndDream,One of the better shows these days,10/10,10 April 2020,"The storyline is so interesting and dynamic, throughout the whole series. It kept me hooked from beginning to the end, so I binged the whole thing in few days. It's perfectly balanced between keeping It interesting and yet not exaggerating with plot twists, so it still feels natural and realistic, opposed to forced which these days often happens in some shows just in order to prolong the season. All the actors did a great job portraying their characters. You can't help but feel somehow connected to each of them in a different way.Sadly I have to say that in my opinion seasons 1 & 2 are a lot better comparing to seasons 3 & 4. Season 3 is still fine but season 4 has some parts which started getting really boring at some point.

1331,TheStorytellingCritic,"Get ready for some exhilarating, smart TV for the first 2 seasons, then switch off your brain and enjoy.",7/10,5 December 2021,"I want to preface this review by saying I came into the Money Heist hype pretty late into the game, so I was able to binge through all the seasons up until the S5 mid seasons finale.TLDR at the bottom.The first 2 seasons of this show were fantastic TV, the whole narrative and the writing really stood out. The action sequences left you on the edge of your seat and every now and then you'd say to yourself ""Oh that's genius"". After S2 had wrapped up, the showrunners ended it with a nice bow and there was no necessity to create more. The 2 seasons were brilliant in itself. The seasons wrapped up so nicely I was able to stop watching after S2 for a while until S5 part 1 dropped so I could binge from S3 to the end (Unaware S5 would be split into 2 parts).Enter S3-5 from Netflix.These latter seasons really just highlighted how much better the first 2 seasons were in terms of how tight the writing was.Let's start with the good. As silly as some of the set pieces are in the show and as silly as the writing has become, it does maintain its' intensity and I truly believe that is only down to two things, acting and the soundtrack. The soundtrack is brilliant creating tension and even creating nostalgia, especially during scenes such as Nairobi's funeral and Tokyo's death. This was amplified by the second half of S5 where I found myself getting goosebumps during certain scenes just from the soundtrack. Seeing the golden pellets shower out of the pipes whilst a triumphant soundtrack plays in the background even though we knew it was going to happen sends chills down the body. The other notable thing was, to me, the best scene of the show was them singing Bella Ciao in the vault room after extracting all the gold; but I'm a sucker for feel good scenes made up of singing and instruments made from the appliances they have on hand in the room as well as any scene where a sombre song is sang whilst intercut with scenes of battle or preparing for battle. I.e. The highlight of S8 in GoT with Podrick singing. Also loved the Berlin and The Professor flashback talking about their dad and why he does the heists.The final 3 episodes of the show really picked up. It put The Professor against the ropes as the gold was stolen from him, something he did not account for and seeing him improvise plans to get out of situations. That being said, whilst The Professor may have been put in situations in prior seasons, it was only in this season it was a high-stake thing as in prior seasons The Professor accounts for everything. If something happened, good ol' Professor had already accounted for the possibility and made contingency plans (bar the last few eps in S5). It almost makes you wonder if The Professor had superpowers if he was The Oracle or if he belonged in the MCU.This low stakes is backed up by the ridiculous plot armour. Gandia, the security guard, was surrounded by everyone with guns and not one bullet hit him. Was the action sequence tense? Yes, for the first minute or so until you realised, they all had clone trooper aim and it became just a boring shoot 'em up. The plot armour was ridiculously irritating. Due to this there were some funny moments for me: in S4 there was a line about shooting the hostages in the vest and I thought they couldn't even shoot one guy out in the open, you think their aim is solid? Sagasta gets a knife shot out of his hand and they say they have good aim. I believe the characters in this show just shoot and hope for the best. You know the one time someone got shot was when Arturo couldn't handle the recoil of the gun and accidently shot a hostage, but don't worry folks, Arturo becomes a weapon expert later using all sorts of guns.Now we come onto the flashbacks. Were they necessary? Perhaps, but definitely didn't need to be that long. It was cool to see Berlin back in the show but maybe a little too much. I groaned everytime a flashback appeared and only appreciated the flashbacks that actually paralleled the heist from planning to execution. However, the flashback of Berlin singing Ti Amo was very well done. Just seemed like a long way to let us know he had a wife and son that betrayed him.As well as this, they really telegraphed plot points happening with Tokyo before her death. They chose that one ep to flashback to her past and show us all of that, made it so predictable what the end of the episode held in store. Which speaking of Tokyo, how was she narrating the show in the final 5 eps?? She is dead. Kept me wondering if she was alive somewhere spectating to be able to narrate but she was never to be seen after, unless in flashbacks so not I don't understand the reason she was still narrating.Overall S1 and S2 had minor flaws to it that were only made apparent by the 3 seasons after but it made for great TV. It told its story succinctly and efficiently and kept us on the edge of out seats. S3-5 turned into a clich√© of tropes making t predictable however it does remain intense making it a fun watch; just don't think about it too much. Whilst the latter seasons did bring it down, the final 3 episodes did raise the bar slightly by putting The Professor in a situation to adapt with great soundtracks and great acting and a nice finale to wrap up the whole show. It was good TV but not at the standard Money Heist once was.P. S. In the finale, I got Michael Bay vibes and I was all for it. It put warm colours all over the scene. The military were there, and they had silhouette close up shots with an epic track. Half expected The Professor's speech to be something along the lines of Optimus Prime's dialogue.P. P. S., They put Endgame style credits on the finale which was cool but disappointed they didn't put Bella Ciao in the background.TLDR: it's a great show that became good but entertaining nonetheless.",Money_heist
1332,virgulillaes,A terrible waste of time.,1/10,19 April 2018,"The writing is as poor as it gets and it requires you to completely suspend your reason and logic in order to follow the plot. I personally found myself unable to sympathize with any of the characters, they are badly done and none of them is even remotely smart or complex. This is one of the stupidest shows I have ever seen in my entire life. I know there has to be an element of suspension of disbelief, but his show requires you to but your brain in the trash bin while you watch this. Plan not using it all. The characters are so stupid and pathetic and one dimensional. DON¬¥T WASTE YOUR TIME. Spanish audience seems to be smart because, in Spain, this show was a failure.

1334,niravpathak,Once they get the money it's all downhill,7/10,3 April 2020,"The heist begins with well defined characters who stick to their persona even as the situation during the heist gets fluid. Season one and two were believable and the characters seemed professionals who fit their roles. However, season 3 is where it all started going wrong. Rigid, lazy and unimagintive writing made the following seasons an overlap of the preceding ones. There characters gave an amateur feeling to the whole scenario and the whole heist started to look ridiculous.

I'm all for characters that have flaws and make mistakes but don't present the characters in your story as professional, intelligent, best of the best, and then in the next breath have them behave completely opposite of how you presented them. I also felt there were quite a lot of unnecessary story elements that were introduced solely to make the show last longer (a ton of fluff).As for the positives...The show looks great, the acting was pretty good and the main plot was a great idea. I just feel in the end if they would have committed to telling this story in a contained and focused 8-10 episodes it would have been a truly great show. Sadly however it was not.",Money_heist

1352,gavneliah,Season 1 was great and then it became time wasting,2/10,12 April 2020,"The acting, filming, special effects, music and the production is excellent.
Season 1 and the start of season 2 was great and very realistic.
Then it was like the pace of the series changed to stretch it and the plot became dumber and dumber.
It became repetitive and some of the actions were so unrealistic that I felt that I was taken for a brainless viewer.
It like everytime the actors had a decision to make, they made the stupidest decision that would extend the series.
It's like Spain had the stupidest police in the world.
I fast forwarded the last 4 episodes of season 2 and then stopped watching because it became too fustrating.

The concept is great but the creators messed it up. If u can bare the first season second season is somehow beter. But for that one has to surpass the 1st season. Once thwy get inside to rob, it looks like they are on a vacation. I personally think this show would have made better with the great script it already has git, but it didn't get executed well.

Secondly, whoever made this tv show, must've watched too much hollywood and hollywood and also thinks he/she knows about psychology. But it is full of unnecessary events, stupidity and unrealistic scenes. Just for example; who in his right mind would even imagine that a boy who has been tortured for 2 months can handlenother heist? another one, Tokyo's character s unrealistically stupid because of impulsiveness, anger, insurgency and lack of any interporsonal skills. What kind of professor would hire a person who has thoughtlessly decided to visit her mom right after making a scene in that robbery which ended up getting her boyfriend killed?
or that rio... what a joke his caracter was! nothing wrong with him if he wasnt picked up for a robby so big by a ""brilliant mind"", The Professor, who played around with all Spain.

1367,abhirajyaguru,A silent chaos is probably the most dangerous chaos there is!,8/10,5 April 2020,"Is this the best heist story ever made?
Maybe not. But La Casa de Papel is pure exhilaration and thrill. The cast, led by the suave yet reticent Alvaro Morte as The Professor, do a terrific job of holding the narrative together while showing their respective idiosyncrasies. The bright red jump suits and the Dali masks they wear are a loud voice of resistance against capitalism. There's enough twists and turns and manipulations and plans to keep you glued as you jump episodes. BUT, the screenplay could have been much much tighter; the series wastes a lot of time meandering from past to present, sometimes testing patience. Even some conversations between hostages and the goings on inside the fortress feel like a drag. I'd give a million dollars (sorry euros) to kill Arturo!
All in all Money Heist is oodles of fun on TV. Its entertainment of the highest form, and it keeps you guessing till the very end (although part 4 was the weakest of all). The motive behind executing Heist#2 also isn't satisfactory ie. risking the lives of 8 members to save 1 (you'd agree on this point after watching part 4)
Give it a watch, its definitely worth the time most of the time.Bella, (Boom Boom) Ciao!",Money_heist

1376,alainrizkallah,One of the best shows I've ever seen.,10/10,13 April 2020,"I don't get the few negative reviews I've seen in here. This show is phenomenal. I agree that some stuff are not realistic, but who said this is supposed to reflect real life. This is cinema, fiction at it's best. Some people said that it should've ended after season 2. I personally think that it could have definitely ended with the second season because a full story was delivered in 2 seasons, however, the fact that the writers were able to re-develop a completed perfect story into a new superb one that spanned over 2 extra season is absolute genius.

I am not typically a woman that enjoys heist movies or shows so I didn't think I'd like it when a friend at work recommended it to me. It is full of action and has a great storyline. Cannot wait for April.
I literally couldn't get anything done with my life while watching this show. Every episode seemed to end with a cliffhanger so I'd just go on to the next episode. The professor (over the heist) is genius and it is so interesting to watch.

1385,Plumski,Loses its way,7/10,10 June 2018,"Like so many TV shows with a core high concept, once it gets into its stride it ties itself into so many logical knots and procedural dead ends that it eventually loses itself in its own complexity. The set up in the first few episodes, inter-cutting the planning and the execution of the plan , works very well, but then the plot depends on the professor being incredibly lucky, and the police exceptionally stupid Much of his plan revolves around the police following their internal procedures to the letter - except of course for when the plot demands that they behave irresponsibly and do not. Sure, let's allow a stranger into the HQ, or to enter a crime scene without protective clothing? Let's drink alcohol on duty, let's not have a clear line f command for when he boss is off to rest or have sex. Let's spend so long suspecting the existence of a human mole but not try to identify them, rather than suspect the existence of a bug? Why did the professor's lessons not include anything about keeping his team's spirits together anticipating that they would start to argue, and make serous mistakes - apart from the few that are part of his plan?As a two hour film or maybe a 6-episode series this could have been truly great but the knots it ties itself into by multiplying the twists are just too much to get out of.Oh, and for such a mastermind with all the disguises, how come the professor only has one pair of fairly distinctively unfashionable glasses, and keeps his very identifiable beard? That annoyed me from the very beginning.That said, the series did pull me in very effectively and Ienjoyed wasting my time in its company.",Money_heist

Then Inspector Raquel must be the dumbest officer ever to ""fall in love"" with someone in 5 days in the middle of a hostage situation. Not only that, she then abandons her police force and side with the criminals. REALLY?!!!!

I wonder what is the reason that a screenwriter or director belittles us so much, even a small child clearly sees the absolute unconvincingness and illogicality of the action and the development of events, as well as the incomprehensible actions of individual thieves. Or hostages too (take cell to let know the police, they are a hostage, wtf???).... It is not enough to say awful!

1407,agarwalprakhar-57298,One of the best series!!,10/10,11 June 2020,"No words for this amazing series! This has been the best series I've seen so far. The casting, story line, acting, everything is just perfect like how the way it should be! People who mostly binge watch thriller series, I strongly recommend you to go and watch this and I guarantee you that the suspense created at every end of the episode will not stop you to watch the next episode.

1409,jeanbeyker,Suspenseful series pack of mind games,8/10,14 January 2022,"This was a series even if you think you understand their plans, you'll be
blown away by how they manage to calculate every possible twists the heists can go.The characters were pretty well developed during all those ""seasons"" even if some of
them died for their cause. All the flashbacks were making so much sense after each
part of the plan to go along with their goals. The mastermind behind all of this was not
The professor but Alex Pina the creator of this eventful series.",Money_heist
1410,blanchiebubbles,A UNIQUE MASTERPIECE!,10/10,18 August 2020,"At first, I was skeptical to watch this show because the title did not seem to interest me much but just after the first episode, I was hooked and I couldn't stop watching. It has a very good plot portrayed by such an amazing cast that I grew to love. This is different than any other shows about robberies/heists because indeed it is more than just a heist- it sends a message to everyone about the resistance and its importance and impact. From the first upto the latest episode, they has been consistent with the pacing and I love how the character developments are valued. They also use little to no CGI and this is what I love about this show. Everything is just perfect!! Such a unique storyline and the professor's plans just blow my mind every single time!

1416,Onjam-54472,Nice,7/10,17 February 2020,"I don't think it's among the best ones but I definitely think it's also not among the worst ones. I'm gonna give a thorough review since I personally liked it a lot although maybe objectively it has a lot of flaws.The idea of it is very appealing since, it's nothing new and unique, it's more ""been there, done that"" kind of scenario but they took an old subject and made it into something very interesting.There are a lot of cliches, I'm a woman myself and I like the presence of strong female characters but in my personal opinion they went there over the line which makes this movie a bit too feminist. The Professor is a cute geek, uncomfortable in that criminal world what makes him seem more like any human being other than some ex war veteran, although he is above average intelligent. The rest of the characters are likeable, every in their own way. I would though ask the Professor why he chose those people for the job since most of them are not particularly smart and I would say they are neither competent nor capable of pulling it off but they probably wanted them to seem like neighborhood guys and gals. I understand that and agree with it but they shouldn't have made them so unstable because most of them are (Tokio is totally unstable and crazy, Rio is an imature, spoiled brath, Denver is good, but pretty stupid, Moscow is also good, but too weak for that kind of job - but we still love them. The rest are less important and the most capable ones are Berlin and Nairobi, with some severe set of flaws, but don't we all have them?)Season 1 was the best, the plan was perfect, maybe too perfect, Miss inspector was not suitable for the job, she got played big time, the police stupid, but let's say they didn't see it all coming so there's an excuse for all of that. Season 2 as well as Season 1 very interesting, some good lines were to be remembered, some dead characters as well, but generally it would be maybe an 8, but then the 3th Season breaks in and ruins the whole thing.
When you have ex robbers not knowing what to do, they go back to robbing, wow what a surpise.
They have a good reason, which is great, we got the police getting a little tougher, Alicia is spicing things up, what we were dying for but generally Season 3 starts well and ending as a copy-paste of it's ancestors. Sadly.It's not that bad though, the ending leaves us thinking about the 4th one which is nice. We are hoping that the producers are gonna surprise us this time, but I don't get my hopes up since the whole show has been tragically predictable so far.This was my objective opinion, the subjective one is that i really like the show, I like the action, I like the caracters, the may not fit in such a tremendous plan but they are there to be humans made out of flash and blood so we're gonna give them a break.I didn't get bored, I like the romance, I like that the Professor is breaking his own rules, I like that a lot and I like the rebellious idea behind it. I'm all in for the 4th Season. I'll be waiting for it. Let's hope that the crew will make up for some obvious mistakes from past.",Money_heist

1419,serenity-56167,The concept was great. But was not delivered.,3/10,26 April 2020,"First of all seeing a movie like this somewhere else other than in an American city was really cool. This daring concept of these heists were AWESOME. I've always loved to see professional criminals pull off a brilliant heist and out smart the cops and all their resources. Again the concept of these heists were awesome. Too bad the mastermind ""Professor"" was too stupid and ignorant to hire professional smart criminals to pull this off. He hired the keystone cops instead. All that people did for the first 3 seasons was point a gun at each other and scream. Twice the police ""snipers"" had shots to take and the were all non lethal shots. What a slap in the face actual Spanish police snipers must feel. I had high hopes but was very disappointed. Get a clue. Let's see true brilliant likable criminals that are actual bad asses and not a bunch of emotional unstable wimps.",Money_heist

(Well part 3&4 anyway) if it was realistic then wouldn't people do it in real life!? These people are criminals and everyone expects them to be rational and logical? Come on.This show was creatively thought out and has great character development. And it's not your typical character development, it's different and sometimes unexpected, which is refreshing. Each character plays a very different role and they make it blend together nicely. Part four had a foreseeable incident that I really didn't want to happen, but it did. Narobi was certainly one of the strongest leads imo. It's definitely worth a watch.",Money_heist

1439,franzcaglioni,Don't watch if you get triggered easily,3/10,6 April 2020,"Big fan of s 1 and s 2, spanish production, good idea, out of many cliches of the American industry. But s4 is complete crap. Full of nonsense, plot holes, and cringe moments. Why do you put so many caracters if you cannot even develop one of them? Tokyo and Rio are so cringe, terrible actors that keep overreacting all the time. Nairobi died when she was the only caracter that could have had a chance to be a good part of the whole disaster. Only Marseille and Berlin are good caracters, all the others are just cringe, screaming and crying all the time. Gandia looks like superman, he cannot die, even after 1000 round shot at him and a grenade exploded behind him. Wow. And why all the flashbacks? Nothing happens in the first 6 episodes, they dont show the actual heist, no tension, to suspence, nothing. You see 3 scenes on repeat, for 5 hours. Another problem, why all the gay scenes, the trans Julia, not even played by an actual trans Actor, just why? Its embarrassing. Did they do it just for the image and to have more follow-up??? And if the professor is such a genius, how could a pregnant woman, with one phone call and a license plate, find the professors location and get into it? Door wasnt locked? No alarm sistem? No camera? Nothing? Wow. Id rather watch some Disney movie, Bambi was more realistic, and for sure less cringe. Don't watch if you wanna stay triggered all day long.",Money_heist
1440,petrvuong,Season 3 and 4 are a steep decline,5/10,6 April 2020,"What made the original series so great was lost on S3 and 4. The genial and calculated plans by The Professor have been traded for emotinally irrational and borderline idiotic actions by protagonists. Moments of wonder and amusement by the well-made plans are gone, now replaced by fury and anger how the hell have they even survived this long.
Perfection is now chaos. More entertaining? Not for me.

1442,NiharikaTP,Officially the best series I've watched so farüòç,10/10,7 April 2020,"I had no intensions of watching Money Heist whatsoever but gave a random try which turned out to be my best decision!
This series is a mixture of Action,Romance,Thrill,Mystery & Humor(Including dark humour).
It literally had me in the edge with a lot of spectacular jaw dropping scenes‚ù§.
The creation of characters is so intricate & smart.
The theme song 'I don't care at all' & the show anthem 'Bella Ciao' are like icing on a cake,They're so catchy that you keep humming all along..
The characters are unique with different backgrounds who get together for the greatest heist in the history of mankind.
The show revolves around the heist & how it transforms their lives be it good or bad.
I hope you guy watch it because its 100% worth watchingüòç.

1443,lrnricci,A terrible fan fiction adapted for the small screen,1/10,15 April 2020,"My Spanish husband was keen for me to watch this but after the first episode I was convinced that this was a show that would be full of clich√© after clich√©.
I would like to ask the writers whether you intend for the audience to take this show seriously or is it a bad take on the 17th century picaresque narrative? Have you ever heard of showing not telling? I suppose in order to compensate for the general lack of talented actors you have to resort to force feeding us their motives and reactions. In the 21st century audiences have come to expect characters who are various shades of grey, not black and white cartoons of good guys and bad guys. I know the police in Spain are not that incompetent so who are you writing for? Is it some type of social commentary? The women in Spain are also not overly emotional who crumble under pressure (To the point where they call their mother from the back of an ambulance). What is the point of a character like Alison (Eye candy)? And don't get me started on Monica (she has some type of personality disorder). Both are cringe worthy. Rio rats out his fellow thieves because things don't go his way and there are no consequences. Tokyo ruins everything and yet she is welcome back with open arms which is ridiculous story telling. This show is written like a bad fan fiction full of Mary Sues.
Don't stick a Dali mask on the show and expect us to believe it is art.",Money_heist

Season 3 & Season 4 is dull, boring, totally out of proportion & has no meaning at all. The characters are totally flawed which get carried to Season 4 too.Specially, the character of Alicia Sierra has so many annoying flaws that i had to skip the scenes she was in, same flaws can be found on Tokyo & Rio in Season 3 & 4. Also Season 3 & 4 tried to go with trending political this is where it falls low.They should've stopped at Season 2 & i hope there will be no Season 5. Let it be there.

1446,nrayhan-09801,Tarantino Inspired Soap Opera? it drags on,4/10,29 May 2020,"It seemed promising, but from the first episode I kept drawing comparisons between this show and Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs from the way they set up the heist planning to giving the members their names to the fact that the entire series is supposed to be the event of the heist. I thought maybe I was unfairly comparing it to a critically acclaimed director, until the show compared ITSELF to a Tarantino scene and acknowledged the similarity when one of the characters said the Spanish equivalent of ""what is this? A Tarantino film?"" and that's why it falls flat. It tries too hard to be that and make two of the protagonists, The Professor and Berlin, the type of character that goes on a meandering speech that eventually makes it way back to the topic in that Tarantino-esque style of writing, but instead of a metaphor that goes full circle everything they say seems clunky and random: essentially 'here's how your sex life is related to this situation' every single time. It also doesn't work because the professor's character is inconsistent in his confidence which is needed for that type of character. All the main characters (aside from Denver and his dad) are inconsistent, some are way too empathetic (never thought I's say that) to be criminals.
The show starts developing characters and then forgets about them, moves onto the main plot (the heist) and then randomly goes back to a character for five seconds several episodes later. It doesn't know to be how to be melodramatic and when to move on. It's one quarter plot development, one quarter characters randomly bringing up personal things that are dropped and never brought up again or brought up episodes later, and half pointless filler. I agree with others that it ultimately drags a plot that could be wrapped up in 2 1/2 hours. It's also amazing how it manages to drag on with anything really happening considering how many side plots there are:
-Rio and Tokyo's love affair
-Raquel and her partners weird semi-romantic relationship
-Raquel's abusive ex
-Raquel's mom's Alzheimers???
-Raquel's child wanting to move out and into her ex's home
-The professors weird obsessive relationship with the lead investigator (why is he trying to have a romantic relationship with the women hunting him down?)
-Rio's personal struggle with being a part of the heist
Monica and Arturo's relationship and their lovechild-Berlin betraying orders and saving Monica
-Monica developing feelings for her capture, Berlin
-Tokyo's identity crisis
Nairobil's child and her complete lack of character developmentand yet it was such a slow burn and my 12 year old sister snd I were able to predict most of the episodes events ahead of time",Money_heist
1447,souravgoodboy,Time is money,10/10,30 April 2020,"Season 1 and 2 were great and amazing, I'd say 9/10. But then Netflix saw a chance to make money and prolongued this show into 2 unnecessary seasons that completely ruined this show. I'm just sick and tired of this by Netflix. This last season was a disaster, filled with unrealistic stuff. Stop before it's too late.

But when it comes to further seasons i was not interested in watching anymore because what new things they can do?? To plan a heist again with same plot???
it took me 2 weeks time to encourage myself to watch more i dont wanted to leave in between.
i have watched entire last seasons by skipping and still i know the entire plot and story...i mean they were just dragging the things.......And i liked Raquel not lisbon
And end of the series i was speechless again but in bad way... It was masterpiece till 2 seasons...
Now i only want to know how will they get out of the bank in next season...and i hope it will be last season maintain its level... until writers dont plan with completely new concept.......

They say breakup heart the most but it's actually seeing your favourite things getting destroyed infront of you and you couldn't do a single thing. They killed the show. Before this season i had given it 10/10 but now it's just disappointing.

Those people who are saying the ending is illogical, Just think properly what professor said :1st case :- If Tomayo will not accept Brass in place of gold then whole Spain will be bankrupt in just few days, you all know 'why'!2nd case :- If Tomayo will accept brass instead of gold without telling anyone ,and also kill all gang members including Professor and Lisbon, then it will be 100% possible that, Professor's other gang members(those who are outside the bank) will leak the information about whole brass thing in place of gold, all over the world !So in both cases Spain would be bankrupt so that's why tomayo have no choice other than to accept professor's offer and let the heist members go away....So Money Heist was the best ever series and the hype for Season 5 was real !!!",Money_heist

The acting is not good, the writing is much much worse. None of the characters behave remotely like real people.... it's a mess. It's basically looney toons robbing a bank, but somehow very sad and excruciatingly boring.

1475,leebutton-06233,Painful watch.,2/10,9 December 2021,Started well. First series very good but then it turned into a ridiculous padded out unbelievable pile of excrement. A child could have written a script with less plot holes and tenuous links. I could list them here and still be going in an hour. You can have one for free. Inspector catches professor and instead of locking him up takes him to the house and gets a lie detector to avenge her anger. Oh and motorbike rides back into the mint being shot at from all corners. Unscathed! Embarrassing. I really started hating both leads at this point. I had a feeling there would be too many episodes to hold this together and boy I was right. Perfect example of chasing volume of content over quality. Could have gone down as a classic but all the good stuff in series one was undone before the end of two.,Money_heist

1477,clairegolec,Long Winded Series of Mind games and Fine Strategies,6/10,2 June 2021,"La Casa de Papel or Money Heist is a Spanish television series which gained fame after Netflix acquired global streaming rights.The drama-action series originally aired on Spanish TV in 2017, but failed to gain traction after season one. It wasn't until three years later when Netflix bought the show and added it in its international catalogue that Money Heist became 'the most-watched non-English language series on Netflix.' Today, it continues to receive the majority of its views and fans from France, Italy, Chile, Portugal, Brazil and Argentina.The series follows eight thieves and one seemingly squeaky clean professor as they attempt to pull off the 'greatest heist in history.'The mastermind behind the heist is the mysterious 'professor,' played by Spanish actor √Ålvaro Morte. His plan is not to be portrayed as criminals, but modern Robin Hoods for the people of Spain by printing and distributing billions of euros in the Royal Mint of Spain. To help him carry out his plan, he recruits eight skilled thieves with nothing to lose. Together, the group of thieves take hostages at the Royal Mint of Spain to aid in their negotiations with the authorities and gradually publicize their presence and purpose to the people of Spain. As more time elapses, the thieves prepare for a showdown with the police.The series is full of mind games and fine strategies. There are now four parts to the acclaimed Spanish series and countless fans including celebrity fans like Stephen King and Karim Benzema.",Money_heist

But then completely out of boredom I started watching by the end of the first episode , I was hooked. The story, the acting , the themes, the symbolism, all of it - phenomenal. Just finished Parts 1 and 2. Never before had a TV show kept me so emotionally attached to its characters and ""on the edge"" until the very end. Exciting plot, great actors etc. But ultimately it is the symbolism (the color red, the Dali masks and of course Bella Ciao) that makes this such a powerful show, evoking a collective yearning around the world for by-gone concepts of resistance, comradeship etc. I and many of my boomer friends in the US and in Turkey watched it breathlessly --and at times, teary eyed. Heartfelt thanks to the entire Spanish team who created it!

First of all, it shows that the government machinery is totally incapable of handling 7-8 people. A cop who was against the people conducting the heist becomes a part of the future heists..Interpol etc cannot do anything? General public is sympathetic towards the people who are looting the exchequer? The same set of people come back in the same country to conduct the heist? The people who are in the heist seem to be like super hero's, can survive and be up and running after being shot and can conduct surgery etc..doctors shd not have to go through such extensive studies if it is so easy. Does not make sense at all.

1491,enockquason,Brilliant,10/10,6 December 2021,"I've never regretted it for a moment since I started watching this crazy thriller about thiefs carrying out impossible heists. It's been such a crazy and yet beautiful ride filled with heartbreaks(think Nairobi and Tokyo's death). Alicia was my favourite character since she was introduced. I just loved the way she carried herself.Season five was my favourite of all the seasons even though the first part was a bit something else. However, the part 2 picked up everything we've loved so far about this series. It had me so much on the edge of my seat that I had to forward scenes because the suspense was too much. Brilliant production.I'm going to miss this show.

1492,officialchunkthemonkey,"Violent, exciting, slick and it is a steal",10/10,3 December 2021,"La Casa de Papel or Money Heist is a phenomenal crime drama. This show is extremely exciting for the most part and was the quickest I had watched a show back to back. It is extremely addicting, since you are always curious as to what the gang are getting themselves into.The show centers around a group of thieves who set out to accomplish the most extravagant heists in the world. The show has been written extremely well and you are always left sitting on the edge of your seat. The first two seasons are the best, and the last three also live up to the excitement. The acts of the Professor are always very slick which adds to the excitement of the show. It also has a great soundtrack and has a good mixture between violence and music.In general, La Casa de Papel is a real treasure to be found on Netflix. The show is also so well written that it seems like it could actually be based on true events. I definitely recommend this.",Money_heist
1493,w_d_bailey,A severe disappointment for me,5/10,31 May 2018,"Given the very high review ratings I expect much better. Most of all this series was, (for me), a dramatic failure.Clearly the writer expect that the audience for 'Money Heist', (English title), would sympathize with the criminals perpetrating the heist; however for me he completely failed. At no time during the series did I have any positive feelings for the perps, and why should I? They managed to hold numerous hostages for over five days with threats and intimidation; one hostage was de facto raped; they injured two hostages and several police officers; they got three of their own number killed (though the writer presumed to shift plain to the police).Perhaps it would be a different to a Spanish audience, but for me the writer's premise, that the theft of cash that the very clever criminals printed themselves at the Spanish Mint would involve anti-establishment and anti-police/authority sentiments among viewers, totally failed.There were other weakness beside the above dramatic failure. Perhaps these were more relevant in the English language version than the native Spanish. However to me the characters tended to be implausible, especially the mastermind, ""The Professor"". Likewise various various events were implausible in context. Most of all among secondary faults, the English voice actors in were poor choice and their director was terrible.",Money_heist

1495,Lora_Croft,If you still like it after all these plot holes...,4/10,13 October 2018,"...then stop reading this. I won't bother with the fact that the story progresses oh so slowly, nor with the repetitive music. I won't even fret over the amount of patience this series demands from you the way it drags certain scenes.I will just mention the 3 lapses of logic that baffle me.
Spoilers for Season 2 ahead1. The clown sceneMaybe if the scene took place in an open space, like a square, then it would make sense how a few clowns got the police confused. But the hospital has what? A couple of exits and entrances? And they were all covered by police officers. And when they saw the clowns, instead of lining them all up to question them, they just allow them to leave in peace. The most conspicuous of all the clowns was of course the cyberpunk Professor, who still managed to roam the hallways undetected. 
All the while 2 police officers were undercover in Angel's room pretending to be himself and his wife. And suddenly they see a doorknob turning...oh the suspense! The suspense built out of the logic that although all the hospital had cameras the one place the police didn't bother to cover was the hallway where their comatose witness was about to be attacked. And for all the disguised police force as doctors and nurses, not even one man was assigned to keep a lookout outside the room. Maybe a clown distracted them by making balloon animals.
2. I left you unconscious to prove I love youFirst of all, Salva, you are the worst boyfriend ever. Not only did you start this relationship out of pure self interest, you are so full of yourself that you feel the certainty that the woman is so infatuated by you, that even when handing her over a gun, she won't shoot you. A professional policewoman, that risked everything on this case, the one you betrayed and irreparably violated her trust, will let you go away, with not so much as even a bullet in your leg.
And you know what? She does exactly that. She actually lets him go. To what end? Even if she loves him, she knows that eventually she would get in trouble.3. Inspectora has a free pass because Casa de Papel LogicThe HQ is fully aware that the Inspectora has an affair with el Professor, so instead of interrogating and detaining her, they simple let her leave the premises. I was under the impression that in such grave situations when people's lives are on the line, even the slightest of suspicions are enough to keep a person in custody. But no, la Inspectora is only a suspect at that moment, and she also wants to go, so yeah, let her go. What could go wrong? After all she convinced you with the lamest line in all the series ""I will prove to you I didn't know who that man was until recently, by giving up his whereabouts"". Funny, because do you know who would also know this piece of information? His co-conspirator girlfriend. And when it turns out that the location she gives was not right (as any dedicated girlfriend would do in order to distract and delay the police) how do they react? They let her go, saying that only Angel can help them now. And she goes in the hospital, steals the badge and then Angel opens his eyes at such a convenient moment for the script that forces me to write all the above.La Casa de Papel has some likable characters and a promising premise. However, after all the slow progression even its good qualities start to wither and you are left with the aforementioned divorces with logic which are simply too much to swallow. The only way to enjoy this series is if it's the first one you have watched in you life or if you turn off your brain while watching it.",Money_heist
1496,enzomarios,It should have ended at Season 2,7/10,25 July 2019,"Seasons 1 & 2 are brilliant. OK some over the top exaggerations did exist - particularly where Tokyo re-enters the bank - but let's surpass that.Season 3 is mediocre, at best. Things just don't make sense - in numerous times. Acting is pathetic (Tokyo & Rio especially). And in general, there's a steep downfall to the series overall quality.Beings honest I have only watched the first 3 episodes, and do not intend (not i am able) to see the rest.",Money_heist
1497,duque-mandas,This TV show seems to be a remake...,4/10,12 June 2020,"It is clearly inspired on the 2006 film titled ""Inside Man"", the storybook is very similar but the Spanish TV show extends it along four seasons!

This is soap opera.I can't believe I wasted 13 hours watching the first season. I liked it alright. But if you can't wrap up a robbery in one season don't make a series.My recommendation, save your time and don't watch this endless PAP.

1499,klodax,Female derogatory,7/10,10 December 2021,"Good show, but the obvious female derogatory is getting a bit annoying by the end of season one. Feels like it was written in the early 90s. Obviously written by a man. I'm hoping this is part of a style that adds to the story, so giving season 2 a try.

1502,peetrutz,The TV version of a child celebrity. From adorable to terrible,5/10,6 December 2021,"I am one of those people who loved the show at first it was interesting, it was exotic, it had charm.The evolution of it unfortunately is one of the worst I have ever seen in a TV show ever.The attention to details is none existant at this point. The constant trick where the audience sees the villan's plan and the hero does not is straight from children's plays. I honestly feel insulted by the writers and directors since they clearly must think the audience is this stupid.The characters' personality changes to fit the plot of every scene.You can see they used up every action movie cliche ever, cars shifting gears for no reason, guns clicking for no reason, spearing the life of a pshyco just to have him come back and do something worse.It is clear as day that the backstory is added just as they were prepearing a new season, just to make a death more dramatic. The timeline makes no sense, rewatch the first season and the characers' personality does not match.Worst of all is that all TV shows should try to educate people on some topics, whether it is engineering, medicine, economics, anything really. This shows gets everything wrong, all their discussions are munbo jumbo or highly inplauseable scenarios. Watching an episode at this point makes me feel guilty for waisting so much time.",Money_heist

All add up to one of the very best programs I have ever seen.This is groundbreaking, it is worldwide, and those of us in the U. S. A seem to be the last to the party !!.Each and every character is developed with great care and skillfully brought to life by actors who leave it all on the set. These actors, obviously gave it everything they had, and their talents are obvious. You become invested in every character, the good and the bad. The script and acting do something remarkable. It shows that each character is both good and bad, they are multi-dimensional as real people are, not stereotypical one dimensional characters that are so atrocious that they are only there to validate the violence of the main character.You feel these characters, you know they are all desperately looking for answers and meaning in there lives. They become bonded and are put through hell together. When each one slowly let's the other's into their hearts they lose them. It's a series of love stories, it is a drama, it is an action movie.Most of all it's a revolution !!Simply superb. I congratulate everyone involved in making this film. You all went from obscurity to being seen for what you really are, among to top escelion of your field.You should all win an Oscar.

The first two seasons were quite good, despite some questionable characters but overall a really good series.Then season 3, well ok it was not great but the big problem really is the characters. Some are too stupid to be real. They are supposed to be among the best thieves around but really, apart from the professor, a blind pig would execute better. It's so ridiculous that you simply cannot take the series any serious. This series has become a joke, the characters mere clowns straight out of Jersey Shore.
It's really become the professor and his circus. Kind of sad!

1519,thomas-147-89750,"Good idea, but drifting away so often wears it out",6/10,14 January 2018,"The first few episodes of the 1st season are killers and they get the viewer hooked up. Good direction, costume design, ideas on the plot, cast. acting.But somehow all this seems to end around episode 4 or 5, when the show becomes a mashup of anything. It's full of meaningless backstory that comes along with the actual happening and there is no room for the viewer to connect the dots. I can't explain without a spoiler but I will give a metaphoric example:Say that the protagonist has a stain on his shirt. It's meaningless right? Well the show will throw a flashback on how the stain got there. For once or twice it's ok but it does it so many times that it starts feeling like an interruption for advertisements. It's trully tiring and my patience only got me to episode 11, two episodes before the season closure that I trully don't care what will happen. Netflix should add a button ""skip flashback"" specially for this show.",Money_heist

1521,Michael-harrissmith,Highly Disappointed,4/10,12 May 2020,"Heard such great things about this series. Finally got around to watching it and realize it's disappointing. These are some of the dumbest, undisciplined bank robbers ever. No one watches the hostages, the robbers are all over the bank leaving the hostages unattended. Cops leave the hostage scene to go eat lunch. This is like a longer, worse version of Inside Man, which was actually a good movie. I don't need to see anyone die, but a organized team would be nice. But then again, I'm only 6 episodes in, so maybe it will get better.

1522,chriss-1991,Its ok,7/10,5 January 2021,"It has some interesting points and some episodes can be smart and keep you on the edge. The writing is mostly bad though. Most if not all the characters have below average intelligence, or at least they act like it most of the time. They seem to be philosophical on one scene and on next they do the worst thing they possibly could , just to drive the plot and spawn more episodes. In the end its an ok series that should have ended after season 2.

The action and plot twists kept me on my the edge of my seat for the rest of the show. The characters made me hate them and love them so much so that by the end of season 3, I was already fearing the end being near. I fell in love with all of them except 1. Maybe it reaches beyond reality at times but I find reality overrated a great deal of the time. The professor had a new plan for everything. Masterful!

It was fun, entertaining, stylish, clever and with some quite likeable characters. It wasn't perfect and had plenty of flaws but it made for great watching and the cliffhanger episodes made me watch ""just one more"" when I should probably have been sleeping. I really liked this show. It really was fun. But it should have ended there. Sadly it did not.Enter season 3. I don't know if the writers and director of the original got replaced, or simply lost the plot, but I didn't make it past episode 4. And that was 2 too many.
I will try to block out ever seeing them so I still can fondly remember the first 2 great seasons.3 comes across like a cheap fan made spinoff, created by an angsty 15 year old antifa kid who really really really wants to be in with the Kool Kids at anonymous, and is an outspoken feminist in order to impress girls and get laid. The stylishness of first has been totally replaced by cheezyness, the once likeable characters feel forced and are annoying, and any realism and grittiness has given way to absurdity.Nope. Season 3 never happened. Do yourself a favor and pretend it doesn't exist.

Not untill Netflix came here to bought it's rights & extended the series to make it a garbage.
Season 3 & 4 feels like a cringy drama film with love & awful plots. And they will now premier another season. I mean seriously. It has become Netflix's cashcow series now they'll produce more garbage no matter what. The show was perfect now It's nothing but awfull drama & predictable twist.

After watching the first two episodes, I shared the link with my friends who are also in this social distance lockdown. A few more episodes, I had to with you recommendation. As another reviewer had pointed out, this is a soap opera set in the name of heists. I finished all four parts on the treadmill, that's what this show is good for.

1551,prisdelcarpio,Pretends to be something...,6/10,2 January 2019,"The concept is good (the idea and the characters) but the execution is bad, this could be summarized in a movie or a mini-series and it would have been better. It's pretentious, and some elements or scenes are copies of other series. The worst part is that the details do not make sense. You start to hate some of the characters because they are so badly written(they are too dumb!!!!!) and some of them can't act, there is no transformation of them and if there is, there is no consistency. The sound mixing is repetitive and several times unnecessary.

1554,igor-suozzo,"Not bad, but still so overrated.",6/10,29 August 2018,"First of all, I think this is my first review (so please be nice!) but I felt it necessary cause when I was watching the show I took a glimpse at this page and saw an average 8,7 rating, which left me a bit surprised, especially when some other movies or series here are receiving very short ratings. Well, as I'm saying in the title, this isn't a bad tv show. I enjoyed it and I watched it in 3 days, but I'd give this not more than a 6,5 or 7 stars rating.The plot (some guys trying to rob the spanish royal mint) is good and haunts you in the first episodes, of course it's a tv series so it doesn't have to be totally realistic and in the first part, as I said, the whole thing works well. The acting is ok and so is the script.
But at a certain point the characters become so dumb that you can't really believe it's a serious script. I won't spoiler anything but they start making choices that no-one would ever make in any situation, and I tend to consider Bank Robbing as a quite dangerous one.
I'm well aware of what the ""suspension of disbelief"" is and I'm totally convinced of its importance while watching or reading fictional products, but here they go a little bit further.But, most important in my not-so-good review is: I strongly hated most of the characters, they're unbearable, they're stupid, they make you want to kill them every time they open their mouths. And if you are rational human beings you'll probably hate them too.By the way, if you just want to relax watching something intriguing without having heavy mental efforts, then go on. :)",Money_heist

It all goes terribly awry because they ... well, behave like amateurs. It's well paced and makes for some good entertainment, but I'm not buying the underlying premise of this ragtag bunch somehow being capable of planning the heist of the century. It reminds me of the sci-fi movie Sunshine (2007) where a bunch of our 'finest' astronauts mess up their mission to save the earth.

Everything in the show was mastered to perfection with very little plotholes and the ending was good as well but I kinda expected it from the start. With the way the show was progressing, I expected much more from the finale. But overall a great watch a d would definitely recommend it!!

1563,msb9,Somewhere between Inside Man and Days of our lives,5/10,29 September 2019,"If you're looking for a show that has the best and worst elements of Days of our Lives, The Room and Inside man, then you've come to the right placeAfter about ten episodes in season 1, I really dont know what is happening.
The plot is all over the place and side plots pop up every 15 minutes, and dont seem to lead anywhere and are buried again. The character development is so odd and illogical and sometimes you feel you've missed 2-3 episodes. Without spoiling anything here are a few examples. Someone is drunkdialing a colleague about how much they love them and refer to a past affair, and the next day, it never happened.
Suddenly the logical somewhat likeble guy is turned to be the bad guy and back again to a good guy (?) And then everything is forgotten. The intellegence officer and the negotiator start out with a pissing contest and you are lead to believe that there is stuff thats ""above the negotiator paygrade"" that are happening. And then theres is nothing happening and everything is A okay.
The group of robbers are first presented as a solid, well drilled, best of the best the country has to offer and all of them have bags of experience from past jobs.
After 10 episodes however..
These are the most unprofessional, no discipline, unloyal, reckless, childish robbers you will ever see and how they ever completed a past job is beyond me. I wouldnt trust them stealing a nickle from my blind and deaf grandmom.The acting is mediocre at best and I cant really point anyone out that is above that.Im going out on a limb here and guess that this show is aimed at spanish talking housewives in the age of 50-70 years that probably have all of DAYS recorded on VHS and are looking to simething similar.Im really surprised the rating this show has (currently 8.6). It has mediocre written all over and therefore no higher than a 5/10 from me.
Unless the writers are some out of this world geniuses andd somehow weave all the plots together in a season finale.cult status potentiale though",Money_heist

Literally all the planning is around how to kill. The heist is focused on in the first 2 episodes, the rest is guns blazing.Secondly, in a small corridor oppositions shoot machine guns, grenades, and rocket launchers etc but none of the heist crew gets any fatal wounds. They fight against opposition after opposition throughout the first 4 episodes with snipers on roofs but they pull through with ease. They took the level of lies to a whoooole new level!!!Lastly, they show some scenes of the past that have very little connection or meaning to the actual heist they're currently in. Maybe they'll reveal the connection in the next episodes, who knows? For example, Berlin is shown teaching his son how to steal gold in a different completely unrelated heist. And other scenes of the character's pasts, like how Tokyo's boyfriend was killed, useless past.Not impressed, AT ALL. It's very ordinary, low standard compared to the previous 4 parts.",Money_heist

There are too many scenes useless, with no point to be watched, just to ""make this episode longer"" and this make the watcher to skip them. Also there is a lack of plot, between the professor and Berlin, are they brothers or what? And is Berlin the kid who felt so bad when he was young? Probably we Weill never know. I ended this series becouse of the character of Berlin and the professor, they are the highlight part. The inspector character is like too round at the end, in just 5 minute she just changed all her ideas, let her daughter and went away. So realistic choices.

1576,ghattasserge,"Original, thrilling and full of excitement",10/10,12 January 2018,"Masterpiece in every sense. Binge watched in 2 days. The show is full of ups and downs where you want the robbers to get away with it every time the police are close to catching them. The characters are all likable and getting to know each of them story and how their personality integrates in the heist is really interesting.

1577,tabrez-81247,Started off well but fast forward to season 5 it's a joke,1/10,4 September 2021,"It's pure propaganda series which encourages viewers to rebel and shows those who rub as heroes. Plus somehow magically a bunch of people win everytime even against an army, intelligence agencies & everyone no matter what the situation is.

1580,yourrizvi,Delivers all the entertainment it promises,9/10,19 April 2020,"Money Heist is auch a quality show. Each cast member seems perfect for his/her role. Professor, Berlin, Tokyo, Nairobi etc. Looks like they are made for this.
Just 2 flaws in my opinion
1. Tokyo's character sometimes becomes annoying. Writers should pay attention to that. Considering the level of the job she is doing, she should be more professional rather than being childish. And also, after all this time she should have learnt her lesson.
2. The actress playing thd pregnant police officer should learn a thing or two about how a 8-9 pregnant lady moves. She moves swiftly, leans on tables and walk speedily. She should have worked on her character better.

No series has ever hooked me with an interest so great such as this one - and I don't even speak Spanish! I found this to be an extremely good series, and can hardly compare it to many others. I would strongly recommend any other person to watch this series, as it's suspense and excitement keeps you clicking 'next episode' as you are filled with adrenaline. It truly is impossible to sleep through or get bored of this series.

1584,seanashkan,This series was one of the best. Season 4 ruined it all. I can't even finish it.,1/10,6 April 2020,"I tried several times now. I didn't even read any reviews before so my opinion is souly my own. What the hell happened to this series? It's SO bad and over dramatic. It used to be a smart show and now it's like they hired indian soap-opera writers for the season 4 script. I loved this series but I can't get through this season. 3 episodes in and I'm just gonna stop watching now. It was a fun ride while it lasted.PS. Whoever made the music for this season should never get a job again. The music is SO overdramatic most of the time. Playing heroic soundtracks while people are just talking. Like do they not have any sense of music and ambience when it comes to film? Jesus christ dude...

Just one plot hole after another, the weird character (the creep who wants to be the hostage just to get laid - season 3 & 4), really funny scenes with our main actors talking about love problems while catching this really bad and dangerous guy.. It's naive & stupid & a true quilty pleasure to watch :)

Starting from Unknown people to becoming the loved ones of the public and to each other,the journey was wonderful and connecting. The Heist didn't felt any boring or unrealistic. I mean the concept of whole is worth watching and the actors have added more stars and a full moon to it.
The master mind Direction to the well scripted writing everything was planned and phenomenal.
I must suggest you to watch this series and after that you will be more attentive and observatory in life. This series not only entertains us but also give us so many messages and lesson that are so helpful in real life.
Go for it.
Although i am waiting for Season 5 to arrive very eagerly.

1591,moussazalzala,Downfall of a show that was once the TV show of the decade,7/10,28 May 2020,"Every successful television show follows the same pattern. Take Prison Break for example, season 1 is a must watch for every person who watches TV. season 2 is great. 3 is fine. 4 is bad. 5 is not worth watching.
The first season of money heist is a spanish and worldwide master piece in the world of movies and shows. It's the TV show of the decade. Season 2 is really great but not like the first. While it is nearly impossible to find holes in the plot of the 1st season. Holes can be easily noticed in the plot of season 2. I didn't buy the incidents that happened in season 2. The plot wasn't carefully developed. But still season 2 is still amazing, great, and a must watch. Money Heist is still the TV show of the decade with those 2 seasons.
Now you would think that season 3 should be great or good. But since Netflix put their hands on this show and since Netflix ruins everything they touch, the whole plot is overwhelmed with holes, it really suck. The first episode of season 3 is ridiculous. How the story started again is pathetic in terms of creativity. The main characters of the show could have appeared on the first episode on season 3 and said we will start another operation because netflix told us to do so and it wouldn't make a difference. If the 1st season of this show started the same way it did with the 3rd season, it wouldn't even be famous in Spain. And the music is horrible. Too many songs like it is an ""American Pie"" movie or something. I guess the budget provided by Netflix was spent carelessly. And then, season 4. The joke. I reached the middle of it and then I stopped. I just read the spoilers to know what's gonna happen so that I can follow up when season 5 comes out even though I am fully prepared for an extreme disappointment. Season 4 is when the bad guy(s) turn into the spanish version of robocop or terminator. It is really disgusting. The good guys become one of those hundreds of soldiers that die one by one against Steven Segal, Chuck Norris, Arnold Schwarzenegger, you name it.
So in short season 1 and 2 are like the true horror films. 3 and 4 are the ""scary movies"" that make fun of the originals.",Money_heist

It's one of the best series I've watched in a while and for sure it's the best non-american series for me.The cast is great, with great acting and the writing is incredible. You like most of the characters and you want to see what happens next for them. The concept is pretty simple but that's not bad. It's very realistic and it doesn't have many no-logic writing just to save the protagonists and that's always a plus for me.Worth mentioning: For me, a good series needs to have good soundtracks and I'm happy to say that they have the right soundtrack for every scene, action-packed, emotional etc.All in all, if you like the concept of a mastermind making chess like moves to win his opponent then you should give this a try.",Money_heist

1606,gk-86934,The complete lack of logic at all.,1/10,7 January 2022,"The story is about one group of idiots trying to catch another group of idiots. The series where you can't believe in what happens in every scene. Are you head of the police operation group? Who cares - just drink and date during your duty. Did you catch the suspect? Just hold him in an abandoned building. Are you a robber who holds hostages and doesn't want to kill them? Just don't wear a mask. Of course, they will not portrait you for police. Are you a genius criminal? Just use your real name. Etc... The lack of logic in every fcknig scene.

A well planned, carefully thought out heist the likes of which Spain (and possibly any other country) has ever seen.Unfortunately it all starts to fall apart when they carry out the plan. Highly unprofessional criminals, stupid hostages, and an amount of drama that would rival any South American TeleNovela.

All of the others are really stupid, all the bad things that happen it's Tokio and Rio's fault, the professor warned about relationships, they could be boyfriends after finishing work but they're so dumb that they screwed up every professor's plan. Something I do not like are the flashbacks these are not interestings and the most of ihis are Tokio getting fucked by Rio and i hate this two a lot. Everything its not bad, the opening's song its good and the animation too. Action scenes are good, and Berlin with hostages scenes are really hilarious.

Full of non sense, the Spanish security authorities should stop this series because it visualizes them as some idiots. Imagine the investigation of this kind of robbery is led by a lady how is the sexually hungry and can sleep with someone she just met three days ago. A very week woman and awkward man (Angel) next to her are investigating the robbery of the place printing Euros!!!. Some co-incidents are fabricated to prolong the serious and continues the scenes. Overall, very awkward piece of work.

1620,irvingiad,Brilliant television worth the binge - 4 days??,10/10,14 December 2019,"From my perspective this is one of the most entertaining and exciting tv series that I have seen in 50 years. And thank god it did not come from the English speaking studios that fall into the same repetitious pattern of predictable boredom. The cast is beyond stunning, the plot intriguing and the acting beyond reasonable expectation. I'm usually overly critical and cynical I always look for the obvious to break the story to no more than an average reality that the plot tries to over represent. Can't do it this time despite the cultural difference. Though I have to admit I keep looking, but this is too good.

I usually get bored with box sets but compared to some of the dross on Netflix, Amazon Prime and Sky mostly made in the USA, this was implausible but entertaining! I watched it with subtitles as I felt something was lost in the post sync good as it was.
It astonishes me the number of terrible reviews on here I would love to see what those people think is good entertainment because unless we are talking documentaries here I found it a great distraction from the CV hysteria.

1633,ppmilona,So many flaws and holes!,2/10,24 August 2018,"The holes in the scenario are SO many! There are things so unbelievable that it is obvious that are occuring just because the writers wanted to reach a predicament, they make no sense! First of all, the thieves leave the hostages alone all the time! Hostages try to help themselves escape in the most ridiculous ways, and no one hears them?? And all the while people are having sex with each other in there? And all the while the Police chick has time to go out on a date???So very flawed it is hard to watch.

And not for the right reasons too!
On the other team, there is this super police captain who is so weak and incompetent she seems to spend more time solving her issues and fixing her own mess rather than focusing on a heist that caught the attention of the nation!Enjoyed a couple of laughs watching season 1, but that's it for me!",Money_heist

You wish it was more sorrow into it. Yes, they lose some members in their ""team"" but besides that, they solve every possible obstacle that they face. It doesn't get that exciting when you know that in the end, they will overcome whatever their opponents do (the military, the police). If they suffered, and that the professor wouldn't be all like ""hey I have a plan for this"", one would sit and be excited about how they would get out, when something doesn't go according to plan.

1649,danielaifraimov,Fantastico,10/10,20 May 2019,"I heard about the series and realized that it was very good. It was hard for me to start seeing this series because the series in Spanish and the language is foreign to me, but I did not let it stop me from seeing what it was about and it was a fantastic and classic series and I started to see the first, second, third episode and I wanted more and more.
Wow, excellent series, excellent actors, excellent investment, excellent decor. There are small things that bothered me, but I do not know if it's just me who is so meticulous. In any case, it is not relevant to detail here as long as it is not something that harms my viewing experience and the quality of the series! I fell in love with some of the characters, fell in love with the Spanish language.
Can not wait for the third season.

BUT it's poor acting, the actors tend to alternate between european realistic style and
adolescent style. The transition between this two didn't go well at all. This series becomes pretty clich√©s, adding a lot of references about past movies, that will never go well. The acting haven't reached the real emotions that characters should have had.Now comes my big problem, how the tv series reached to people. The show wants to represent a tribute to partisan and the connection between it and public come with the song ""bella ciao"". In my country, now, everyone wants to take part of ""resistance"", the conception of all resembling a superficial layer of understanding, they pretend to understand some aspects about what happened, although actors are quite reluctant about data exposure.One final idea, the acting, that is very attractive and easy, makes the public to feel that they understood the story, making them feel special.",Money_heist

Season 03 & 04 are totally predictable and the Arturo character is just annoying. I still think by hiring some good writers who can do the trick might improve the show. A lot of unnecessary past scenes that were extremely boring.
Basically a Spanish Salman Khan show.
Please please hire good writers or just end the show already.

1660,schnuck,Poor imitation,1/10,10 December 2021,"Almost everything about this show is awful. Who on earth did the casting? Most of this gang cannot act. The worst example is the son of that bearded guy. Cringe over cringe. He can't even fake laugh. Giggles like a toddler the whole time so much that you wish he is going to be first one to get shot to take him out of his misery. All the pretended coolness is so cringeworthy. The ridiculous ""Pulp Fiction""-style discussion over the masks in the back of the truck almost made me burn down my house with fire.The gang leader wants to make you puke particularly in the scene where the hostages are lined and he goes from one to the next and whispering them cringe into their ears. Trying to be so cool, but nope, he is not. Ughh. According to the trailer, it is revealed that nobody takes him serious anyway. Then the scene where the bearded guy ""cracks"" the 60cm thick main safe door with a simple blow torch. LOL. He cuts through a surprising only 1cm ""thick"" metal cover like through butter and then pops it open with an off the shelf screwdriver in under 5 minutes - what a joke. Really? The Spanish National Mint's main safe is that easy to open? Have these people never watched other movies to see how it's done? And all this time they are so adamant about being incognito - except 3 of them being unmasked for most of the time. And the hacker dude - clickety-click - fist pump, hacked the whole system with a GUI using Visual Basic. And forget about a one night stand - our ""Little Lamb"" seems to be after a one hour stand. The scene with the selfie is unreal. It's her phone - why is she panicking? And how does that dude think the photos will go viral - photos are still on her phone! The main character in search of ""Little Lamb"" is literally checking every executive room (rooms where teenagers would never dare to enter to make out) except the most logical places - the goddamn bathrooms! So many movie mistakes in 1 single episode. The big hairy brother dudes were introduced as the only weapon experts, yet everyone is running around like Rambo. Not a single scene was shown what in those 5 months has happened. Not a single scene showing the crew being trained in how to use a weapon. Alas the sad scenes where they shoot like in a cartoon. Spray and pray, I guess. Although, apparently the love birds had sex every day in those 5 months. In those 5 months there wasn't even a proper briefing by the ""Professor"". It is a miracle how he tracked down the main character. Not only tracked down but took those surveillance photos of her granny's house and then promptly drove to her to recruit her. How the hell did he know which public phone booth she was using? The list goes on and on. And this was only episode 1.All those 10/10 reviews must be Spaniards who are voting purely out of patriotism or have never seen a good show/movie before. I could barely finish episode 1. I had no more cringe-energy left towards the end. I should have known better because the trailer alone gave hints about the cringe-levels of this abomination.You want to watch a proper recent heist movie? Watch Army of Thieves. There are many many examples out there.",Money_heist

This series is a fairly light story, but there are heavy parts too. There are plot twists that sometimes we don't think about. The genius of the professor will amazed us. By watching this, I became quite fluent in Spanish, and let us know all the stories and reasons from the robber's side. Once again, this series is a must watch!!!

Seemed a little unreal.The English subtitles were exaggerated & did not synchronise in some places

1683,eubijoy,Outstanding tv series ever,9/10,1 May 2020,"GREAT!!! Probably one of the best Netflix series I have seen so far. With its unpredictable and overwhelming plot, this series so addictive that one will definitely complete it in binge watch. The series revolves around a very strong, mysterious, genius yet very kind man name Sergio Martinez(The Professor) who spends half of his life planning the biggest robbery in the history with a very dangerous but capable crew. The producer and team has done a really good job creating a tense environment which suits the storyline of the series. All the actors have done a fine job with their characters. No doubt about that. In my opinion, if you love watching crime movies and series, then you should not skip this one. No way! This is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SERIES.Loveeeeee itt.

If you don't like the previous seasons give part 5 a try, I promise you'll love it. And if you loved the previous seasons, it will amaze you even more. Part 5 is much better than anyone expected.

1692,Ferz2305,"Seasons 1 and 2, brilliant. Season 3 and 4, not so much...",8/10,17 April 2020,"Seasons 1 and 2 were wonderfully executed, and made for a great watch. I'd give a 9/10 for the first seasons, but the last two seasons were so poorly written with the dragging, boring flashbacks and clich√© action scenes.The second season would've ended the show perfectly. The new seasons are very disappointing, and there will most likely be a fifth season judging by the ending of season 4, but I'm not expecting anything other than a stretched out finale for the show.

1693,midhunnedumparampil,Waiting for Season 5,10/10,1 August 2020,"One of the top 3 trending shows in India. And why not. Deserves to be there.
You fall in love with the crime. That's the power of the story. The perfect heist, the biggest heist in history is what they are planning. Love, hate, romance, death builds up in the process. Every character is played so real that you tend to love each one of them. You don't want anything to come in between their heist.
The Professor is one hell of a nerd you can think about. He's got everything planned, every small detail. Even the way he runs at the scrapyard is so damn authentic. Berlin is a piece of art. His theories and ideologies makes you fall in love with him.
I leave it for you to have your take and experience an extraordinary take of heist.
Eagerly waiting for Season 5.

The acting is top-notch. The characterisation of each character is fabulous. The screenplay is tight and edgy. It has awesome toe-curling moments.

1697,jgeorgelafayette,A Long Soap Opera of Inept Robbers and Police,3/10,17 February 2020,"While some of the technical genius of the robbers is very interesting, the series just drags on and on and on. You see flashback or robbers you don't care for as they all have their broken down issues. Amazingly stupid to think their plan was going to work. Then we have the inept police. For a long time, they kept shooting and hit no one (ok, they finally hit a robber in a later episode). But, the viewer has to be brain dead to take this all in. The lead detective falls in love with the lead robber, all kinds of mistakes by police are made, lead detective finally figures it out and captures the mastermind at gunpoint. Does she call her police allies and come and take him off to jail? Nope. She takes him to the old hideout, interrogates him, and ultimately lets him escape. How stupid is that? I found myself screaming at the TV to her. I have not finished the whole series yet, but I am ready to shut it off if they don't get through that tunnel and escape pretty soon. It goes on, and on, and on! zzzzzzzz",Money_heist

Maybe if the show was shorter it could be rated 5/6.Episodes after episodes, the action is replaced by a soap-like melo-drama, where the life and feelings of the protagonists are more important than the heist.You are lead to think that the robbers are deep interestng people, but the artificial chaos created around them and their illogical and irresponsible reaction to that only makes all of them fools and unprofessional.What they try to tell you:
Profesional robbers with high expertisePerfect plan that anticipate everythingWhat you actually have:
Unprofesional robbers that act like teenagers and can't handle any contrarietyPlot holes with inconsistant behaviors, reactions and situations",Money_heist
1703,mrezamhmdian,Highlights of the film and my personal opinion,9/10,4 December 2021,"One of the best movies and a good director and a great acting team.The first 4 seasons were both daunting and painful due to the loss of some team members, and for every plan they had that had already been drawn, they stole a throwback to the previous time, which paved the way for the formation of their plan.The remarkable point of the film was that after T's death, the story was not told in his own language and it was a point that surprised me.Another point that he had in the last season after the painful incident that happened was that Rio was not the weak point of the team, but Denver took his place, and at the beginning of the movie, the professor said that during the robbery, you should separate love so that there is no problem. Now, until the first 5 seasons, Rio and Tokyo were the problem of the team, but in Part 2, Season 5, Denver became the team's weakness.In short, it was a film in which in each episode and sequence, when a problem arose outside the bank or inside the viewer, he measured all the possible possibilities in his mind, but suddenly, by solving that problem, the interactions of the mind were disrupted.It was a good movie. I hope the spin-off of the Berlin movie is also good.",Money_heist

Professor knows everything, no matter what's going to happen. Main characters rarely die and if they do it's a heroic death. Always the same methods to make police officers do what they want. Relationships between the characters are rarely catching and to me it's just bad acting since season 3.
The motive for the second heist is just a joke. They should have ended it after two seasons. Now it's pure greed, nothing more.

However, the writing is getting worse and and worse and they are going further and further away from the quality of season 1. I just finished season 4, and it was almost unwatchable. You have these 8 or 9 thieves who were 'hand picked"" due to their skills, yet halfway through the show you have none of them doing the things they are supposed to be good at. They are all just going off plan and acting like 2 year olds. Real crooks would be focused on getting the money, nothing more. The last 2 season you've add 2 or more of the crew doing nothing but make trouble for everyone and trying to bang hostages. Enough already! Let's face it, we as viewers just want to see them win - get the money, get rich and move on. We really don't care that Nairobi gave her crack baby away or that Moscow is gay. WE DON'T CARE! Get the gold and end the season for God's sake.

I know a lot of people thought it should have ended with season 2 but I disagree seasons 3-5 were some of the greatest works of art I've ever seen. In my opinion I really hope they continue to bring out seasons with new heist and bigger explosions because I really do love this show. Even if they just make spin off shows with new characters.

1. We don't need a boring recap of a character who has to the present.
2. The show writer distorts the story of previous seasons to create money-making new season Which is not good.
3. Just because of the first seasons on the fanbase has created a hype which will get killed by boring season like the 4th one.
4. No intelligent writing and really stupid character except the professor.
5. It's difficult to love a character. I literally laugh and enjoyed when one main character got killed in season 4

I cannot wait for season 5 and this deserves to be in the top 10 tv series of all time.The first two seasons were amazing but then it got better and better, the music, the atmosphere, the acting is on point. You will love the characters Moscow, Denver, Nairobi, Tokyo. Of course the professor is the key also.You will not be able to sleep after you see season 4 last episode and cliff hanger. Believe me if you know anything about film you will love this show. Users who class this anything less then 9 are wacko's.

Terrible representation of Spain's military and police force. Just terrible and the action scenes are all bullets flying around with no reason.

All the cast is so good that you fall in love with them. 3rd season is also good And it slows down a bit in 4th season. But the thrill in the show covers up all things. So one of best show I have seen recently. Please watch it if you haven't yet. For me it's 10/10

1742,ellaine_siruelo,Totally Overrated!,3/10,1 May 2020,"Watching the 1st three episodes of Season 1, one can already predict the future of this series. It's like watching noontime soap opera. The ""profile"" of the characters, who were first and foremost selected due to their ""hard core"" ""nothing to loose"" personas is completely contradictory to the way they unfolded themselves in every episode. Too many irrelevant and stupid scenes (constant recall of Berlin's wedding unless Tatiana turns out to be Sierra!) and characters (Arturo for one!), Racquel sitting for hours in front of Alicia saying nothing when she was once one of the best hostage negotiators, Robbers making a mockery of themselves in front of their hostages by bickering and contradicting each other, the professor getting annoying by the minute. I think the writers under estimated the intellect of the viewers. I can't believe they killed Nairobi's character when she is the one compensating for the stupidity of the others. Overall, the series doesnt have the charm of Italian Job and the thrill of The Bank Job. If the viewers want to have some netflix excitement- i highly recommend Vis a Vis (Locked Up). Stay safe everyone!

1744,NotJusstAnotherReview,Money Heist Part 4 Review,9/10,5 May 2020,"La Casa De Papel, Part 4After a Successful Heist at the Royal Mint of Spain, The Professor and his team try to take on Bank of Spain and this time it's not for Cash, but Gold. This plan, however, is made to extricate Rio, from the police who have taken him prisoner unofficially in a remote undisclosed location.This season gives us more reasons to believe it's just not about the heist, it's about resistance, Resistance to the Govt and the Police, and very well depicted with the song Bella Ciao, which is not the theme song but it has given a strong identity to the series, the impact of this song is so huge that whenever you may listen to Bella Ciao, you will think of Money Heist.Money Heist Part 4 Let the Chaos Begin:-
Like the first 3 seasons, this one will also keep you on the edge of your seat, right from when Nairobi was shot in the last episode of Part 3, you are keen to know whether she will live or not, Professor who thinks Lisbon is dead in Part 4 can be seen mourning gut-wrenchingly leading you to think why did they have to kill Lisbon? Until suddenly, the episode starts getting interesting after the professor's conversation with Tokyo when he explains how Lisbon was executed.In the throes of mourning Lisbon's death, The professor let his guard down and it was interesting to see how he tries to make a daring and dangerous escape from the police. Will he escape, of course, he will...it's no surprise that the Professors brain thrives, especially in dreadful situations.If you missed Berlin, he is back in a Flashback that is based around his wedding, his plan to steal gold and his love for Palermo.The 1st Episode of Part4 is named Game Over, not yet obviously as there are 7 more episodes to go.
In this one as Arturo the annoying character comes back he tries to create a rift between Denver and Monica while trying to win the trust of hostages in planning a revolt, but no one wants to listen to him this time. Arturo fails to have an impact on us in this part.The intensity of the Negotiations between Alicia, the pregnant police appointed negotiator and Lisbon is very gripping, and when you think Lisbon is about to reveal everything, the professor comes up with yet another mastermind twist where he makes contact with his love Lisbon through Colonel Tomayo's assistant, Benito. How the Professor gets policeman Benito to work for him is another interesting episode.If you thought there were many annoying characters like Arturo or Inspector Alicia, then here comes Gandia, The Chief security officer for the governor of the Bank of Spain, it was interesting to see the way he escapes the captivity and how he turns out to be a single yet a strong threat for the Professor and his team, he does succeed for a bit and ends up killing one of the key members in the professor's team.So a lot of engrossing situations arise simultaneously, Lisbon is being interrogated at the tent outside Bank of Spain, Inside Gandia is creating havoc while the gold Is being melted and outside the Professor is desperately making a plan to save his team.The Episodes are so gripping that you wouldn't blink an eye, especially when the Professor plans to save Lisbon while she is being transferred to the court and that is when the Paris plan gets activated. The professor successfully creates a rift between the pregnant negotiator Alicia and her boss Tamayo....but how Alicia gets back to the professor is something you will enjoy watching in the last episode, for once there is someone as smart and crazy to match up to the level of the professor. It ends with Alicia and the Professor standing face to face with a gun on his head. We are eagerly waiting for Part 5 to see what happens next. Will the professor be caught? Or will the team successfully fly the coop with gold?Interesting Facts :- Nairobi's Name was supposed to be Cameroon, The Professor was supposed to be the narrator, the makers then decided on Moscow because of his subtle and light-hearted tone, but finally settled with Tokyo as the narrator. The location used to shoot the Bank of Spain is a govt complex called New Ministries....The Salvador Dali Masks they used is not the only ones they thought of, they were going to use Don Qui-Jote's image, but settled for Dali masks as they were more striking, infact bollywood actors are so inspired by the professors character that National Award Actor Ayushman khurana posted a video of him wearing glasses and playing bella ciao on his piano and Kartik Aryan also posted a look similar to that of the professor.",Money_heist

This drama focuses on every person and and I really enjoy how the story develops, with a reasonable amount of tension and suspense to keep you hooked.The characters are played really well by the actors and actresses because i really ended up hating Arturito haha.Its a tense show so be ready XD

1752,ashiginni,Dragged with s2 but great!,7/10,4 July 2021,"The show is an amazing piece with amazing actors. The storyline is brilliant and it comments on human experiences in its own way. It is truly an amazing piece however I do feel like they dragged the piece along. The newest heist added an edge to the series, the less perfect but it undermines the plot. There are huge plot holes which makes you question the writers. Still, it is an amazing show and is definitely worth the watch. Just don't worry about the plot holes!

1758,saurabhr-42068,Money Heist Season 4 : A story which keeps you glued to screen.,9/10,27 May 2020,"Money Heist or La Casa De Papel Season 4 has been released on Netflix globally on 3rd April 2020. It is one of the few foreign language Series which got so popular in few time in India.The 3rd season left everyone in shock and mystery and if you are thinking this season is going to be last and will have all the answers, well I'm sorry but it doesn't. This season is filled with more shocks and twists. Like previous seasons, this season also keeps you thrilled and surprised.As usual there is suspense in the end of every episode. So you can't delay it, you get addicted. Dialogues are main masterpieces, some of them have a new kind of feeling and inspiring level.At first it was just a team, but the way everyone gets bonded like family is shown fabulously. At some point it feels like real life, you will forget it's a fictional story, and that's much you are going to love it. Negative characters are also real gems in this story, you keep hating them on every step till the end. Small things like flashbacks, lunches, love stories, songs, celebrations, Denver's laugh makes you happy, feel loved and keeps you emotionally attached to the story. The scene where Helsinki plays Harmonica for Nairobi's funeral is real heart touching.Character development is amazing in this season. For example at starting you hated Palermo but as you start to know him more and more you are going to love him. Just like when everyone hated Berlin in Season 1, but ended up loving him in the end of Season 2.Whenever you lose hope and feel like whole plan is failed now and everyone's gonna die or going to jail at that moment the professor touches his spectacle and smiles at that moment a small smile appears on your face too without you knowing. And then you know this guy also have planned for this situation, and just in few minutes professor takes control of whole situation.It is a must watch series before you die.",Money_heist

Very bad writing and full of fillers, despite the good first seson but all that follows is uust rubbish and the ratings show that people didnot like the growth of the characters nor the heist storylines or dialogues.
I really donot recommend it to anyone, it was a waste of time and money really.

1772,jurassic-17242,The Best Show On Netflix.,10/10,10 August 2020,I am sorry but this is a top tier show. No doubt that this tops over all the hit shows! Money Heist/Lacasa De Papel is about a group that plan a massive heist against certain places or banks. The storyline is addictive you get really attached to the characters like me with Nairobi it was really sad when she died I was balling. Obviously when the show was released it wasn't given to much attention but when Netflix picked it up everyone loved it which was so admirable! Thank you for giving me the best show ever! - Tomas,Money_heist
1773,soltrdc,Stupid story with ridiculous characters,2/10,11 August 2020,"I signed up on IMDB just to post this review because the show is so bad. It is bad because it is absurd.Almost all the main characters are irritating at best and disgusting at worst. A heist planned by a supposed-genius who chooses absolute idiots for the team. In reality no one would sympathize with them. What's even more absurd is when you consider the time frame (under a week) that the entire story takes place. Yes, truth is sometimes stranger than fiction but the level of ridiculous in this show is off the charts. I'd rather watch SpongeBob SquarePants if I wanted mindless entertainment, at least it makes me laugh instead of wanting to punch my monitor. It is truly an insult to every group of people portrayed in the show.

The only reason I rated it 9 instead of 10 in because I am British and when I watched this series it was a Spanish series but it was dubbed in English, I would rather it have stayed Spanish and just had English subtitles. But in the end, apart from that I have nothing against the series and in one word. It is a masterpiece.

1779,maniacalert,just tragic.,3/10,15 June 2021,"I never planned on reviewing this show but with the new teaser for season 5 (awful cringe-fest), I felt like I should warn new viewers or people who plan on watching la casa de papel.It starts of with an intriguing concept, well rounded cast and a potentially good storyline, but it crumbles too soon. Season 1 was a solid 7, being all critical but season 2 wrapped up in shambles. The 3rd and 4th parts are just tragic to even watch through.I felt like I lost brain cells watching some of the episodes which sometimes felt as if the writers and directors crafted it for mere boredom.

1802,okurnaz-65843,T√ºrkiye'den.,7/10,7 January 2022,"There is only one error. You steal gold from the reserves of a European state like Spain and you celebrate it by saying bella ciao. There is not one poor person in this country. While everyone is living in prosperity, these things have nothing to do with the Peter pan or Robin hood analogy. Come on, you can steal the money stolen through corruption in Turkey, for example, 128 billion dollars and distribute them to the public, or you can buy it yourself, it's not a problem. The real heroism is hidden in this. If you do it in Spain, you're a terrorist. But if you do it in Turkey, at least you know that the money doesn't go to useless politicians. In this respect, I think the show is illogical and the thieves are not praiseworthy.

1803,senroshni-04797,Money Heist is worth to watch!!,9/10,6 June 2021,"A band of robbers, lead by a man known simply as 'the Professor', infiltrate and rob the Spanish National Mint. They appear to bungle it, ending up holed up in the Mint with 67 hostages. But it's all part of the Professor's plan. If it succeeds, they'll make off with over $2 billion Euros.Entertaining, initially, and could have been a masterpiece. The initial plot - the plan to secure the Mint and make off with over $2 billion Euros - was very clever and intriguing. It was also engaging: you got to know the individual characters of the heisters, as well as who they were up against. From here on I expected a taught, gritty battle of wits and wills between the robbers and the police.Unfortunately, that didn't happen. Instead of being tight, the plot diverged into silly escapades. One escapade lead to another: robber has to fix some error, fixes it, unwittingly causes another issue, now has to fix that, rinse and repeat. What's worse, the errors, solutions and escapades were incredibly implausible, just being antics for action sake.In addition, having established their characters in the first few episodes, the robbers then do several things counter to their characters. It was as if the writers wrote each scene independent of what had happened before. It could not have been more random if they brought in a different writer for each episode, and told them not to read the scripts of the previous episodes.The further into the series one went, the worse it got. During the first season the good, clever plot developments generally outweighed the random, implausible, stupid ones. By Season Two it was open season, with dumb stuff being the norm. The dumb plot developments became predictable, eg you have a situation where a character has a choice and the logical thing, the thing people would do 100% of the time in real life, is to do A. However, A would mean the series ends, so the character does B, and the series continues.So the plot only makes sense if you're mind-bogglingly stupid.By the end I just wanted it to be over, so my intelligence would no longer be insulted. And yet it still got drawn out, by about 2-3 episodes too many.And apparently there's a Season 3 in the works. Considering how it ended, not sure how that's possible, but the producers did manage to turn what should have been a 8-or-so episode mini-series into a 2-season, 22-episode series.",Money_heist

Each episode has some sort of twist and keeps the audience engaged in many ways, such as what's happening with person A or what's happening with person B. The ending is perfect and it's heartbreaking that there aren't shows out there that produce this level of quality.I definitely recommend it.

A must watch, good thriller and actions. Waiting for the Season 5 eagerly to see how it ends. But this series deserves a lot more appreciations and ratings, it's not overhyped but a great series.

1814,ashfaqshahriarayon,This show is not that bad as it seems,8/10,19 June 2021,"I would agree with what most people has been saying. It should have ended in season 2. But it doesn't deserve 1-5 rating.This show has few boring parts compare to Breaking Bad. Not comparing tho! Money Heist may not be the greatest show but it is indeed the greatest heist show I have ever seen.And it would be illogical to compare this show with Prison Break cuz PB is a completed series. Money Heist isnt. But I have high hopes that it will have an epic ending.

It both has drama from the heist and romantic part to it. In my opinion season 3 and 4 didn't meet the expectations after the first two. It feels kinda forced because everybody was so obsessed when it came out on Netflix that it kills all the good from the first two seasons. If you can watch the first two season and you will end up loving it to the top.",Money_heist

1824,itsamemari0,"Netflix's most infamous ""money heist""",7/10,5 December 2021,"The first two seasons of this show are so good. Absolute must watch. The show should've really ended after them though. Or maybe after a ""Where are they now"" mini season. All of the characters had their arcs finished and the ending was all around satisfying. But Netflix saw that the show had become a global phenomenon after they had bought it, and decided to make a few extra bucks by continuing the already finished show by making three big budget seasons.Netflix's decision probably paid off for the actors and Netflix themselves, but the show's quality suffered a lot from it. What was originally a 9/10 show turned into a 7 or 6 /10. The writing got a lot worse, the show got turned into more of more of a action show compared to the first two seasons which were more of a thriller (which originally made it so good), and there was nobody to fill the void after the death of the charismatic Berlin. Although Netflix really tried to fill that void with Palermo, they did not succeed at it. He is just inferior in every way. Also Murillo's successor Sierra is nearly not as good and relatable of an inspector as Murillo was.After finishing the show yesterday I can say that the last three seasons had some emotional and good moments, but they still fail to outshine the well written and thought out first two seasons. Netflix didn't ruin the show completely by any means, they just made it a lot worse by continuing an already finished story.",Money_heist

Never have I had such a range of emotions while watching something. Like you literally scream when they win any small battle like your favorite sports team just scored a goal. I find myself legit caring about the characters and their fates, this is how you make a series, movie, etc.. I don't ever want it to end!

1837,adriansolorzano,Makes Game of Thrones last season look like the next 2001: A Space Odyssey,1/10,8 September 2021,"Overly dramatic the sense that it doesn't care about the audience's intelligence. The acting is bad, soap opera bad. The music is overly everywhere in a way that it doesn't let you seep in the emotions but instead food spoons you. This like the transformers movies. Purely eye candy and entertainment with no substance and sadly, artistically no redeeming values. It's unfortunate that if this is what passes for good entertainment nowadays... tv will get worse in a sense with less substance, thinking, good execution and bad acting.

1868,user-25985,It's good but not as good as they claim it to be.,3/10,25 September 2019,"It starts with a strong note, a good story and great characters but soon it starts falling down from reality to fiction and filmy story..
I would have preferred if they had stuck to the original story of a brilliant perfect plan and conquering obstacle instead of over using the Stockholm syndrome to a level where even police would start to help them.
By the time the second season ends, I just wanted to quit watching it but I was hopeful it would get better. It didn't.
Somehow it convinces you by the end of the show that robbers were good people and the police was bad in trying to save the people.
I don't know why they wanted to glorify the robbers and showcase the bank robbery as a great revolutionary thing.
None had done any great service to anyone by robbing the mint.
Who were they fighting against and what was the resistance?
It turned from a brilliant series to a extremely stupid one in a very short time.
I still don't know what the craze is all about.

Started a bit promising with a nice heist setup, which felt intriguing enough to make up for the bland choice of music and some ridiculous non-ironic slow motion shoots.

1873,federer91,"Americans don't understand LCDP. It's deeper, than just a heist.",9/10,15 April 2020,"What started as an ambiguous show on a Spanish TV channel, became one of the most popular shows in the world. There has never been a more popular TV series not in the english language. And i'm glad Netflix shared this amazing show to the world.If it highlighted one thing, it is that many Americans still don't understand Europeans and their style of film making. They are so accustomed only to their shows, they can't fandom anything that is presented to them from outside.One of the major ""flaws"" i see being brought up is that the characters are unrealistic and not believable. On the contrary, i think they perfectly show the real human nature. Real people, real emotions, different situations, with their highs and lows. It's something you will see, if such things happened to a regular person. European film makers have always showed more feelings in their work, because Europeans are that way.Many Americans expected an action heist series, with their typical robot characters seen in every criminal / police shows, who are always cool under pressure, never miss a shot, know what to do in every situation... LCDP is not like that. Every character enters in the heist with a job, but their actions are fueled much more by their inner feelings, their scares, their beliefs, their struggles, their dreams. They can't be perfect all the time. Of course they will make mistakes, of course they will make snap-decisions without thinking. Every person will act that way in such high-tense circumstances.The character relationships is the base and what makes LCDP.",Money_heist

Slow, dull, paper thin characters and extremely unlikely scenarios.I checked out after Season 1. I just couldn't cope with the dumb scenarios anymore. I swear no character had an IQ above 70. Except for the Professor who might range in the
80's. No seriously, his team consisted of eight people who consisted of true bottom feeders - murderers and other failed criminals on the lam. The hostages are not much better.Music was good though.

Please don't compare it with ""prison break"" it's 100 times intresting and witty than prison break. I like the idea how master mind planned the heist with out voulnetry involving any one in the murder plus it's not like long stretched American serials with every season every year for 7 or 12 years most of the fans die in between and the serial never ends. Acting was excellent specially the character Berlin and professor. My suggestion is just give it a try if you can follow serials for 6 or 7 seasons for years there is no harm in watching 2 seasons of such an amazing and refreshing drama.

1901,kashi-mails,One of the best Netflix titles out right now,10/10,12 April 2018,"Netflix has a knack for knowing what its viewers would like. I didn't think so when I saw this title keep popping up on the home screen. I ignored it for a good 2-3 weeks before I bit the bullet. After all, I'm learning Spanish so why not get a little vocab practice, right? The first episode took some adjusting to; this is the first (but not last) Spanish-language TV show I've seen. Patiently watch the first 2-3 episodes then you'll be rewarded with a ride like nothing you've experienced before. I was on the edge of my seat - all without the usual tropes used in English-language shows. It was a wholesome kind of experience. I can't explain it any other way. Do yourself a favour - if you have the day off, block out 8 hours to finish Part 1. Then ask your boss for another day off to power through Part 2. I'm not a bingewatcher these days, but the cliffhangers in this show make it impossible to wait!

1906,guilhermeoderdenge-281-686263,Not for the critical outlook,1/10,7 May 2018,"Don't let the good score and reviews fool you.La Casa De Papel IS NOT about a heist. La Casa De Papel IS NOT about their plan. La Casa De Papel is just another teenage drama speaking spanish rather than english.I love the european cinema. It always calls my attention because contrary to Hollywood, I have the feeling they always try to innovate their formulas, and La Casa De Papel is no different.As I mentioned, it's a teenage drama. And yes, it's innovative because of its heist background-a merit I can't deny.But don't get me wrong: their innovativeness fails in every aspect but the innovation itself.Characters are all dumb, including acting-except Berlin,-omnipresent plot holes, stereotypes everywhere, and the problems they face aren't intelligently or logically resolved.Most of the solutions are improvised-despite the months on planning to actually perform the heist,-gambling-based, or poorly developed. When they can't think in something that doesn't fit any of these categories, there's the last resort: a very stupid, irrational bi-polar character called Rio which is the xXYoung_HackerXx that has the superpowers of create bombs, bypass any security system created by the most advanced security companies of Spain, go to the gym and shoot with guns-all this alone, by the age of 19 and at once! The new McGayver is Spanish!If you like a teenage drama, go for it. It really has the merit of entertain, but hardly fails when it comes to seriousness. If you are looking for a detailed, well-executed with great acting heist piece, just forget it. There's no brilliance here. At all. And oh, the ending is just... bad. Predictable to say the least.",Money_heist
1907,kmehult,"This is only for ""Kids""! Not even the LOCKDOWN STUFF!!",1/10,24 May 2020,"I think this is getting popular because nowdays more and more teenagers have started to watch serieses and started to watch NETFLIX and PRIME VIDEOS (all beacuse of free/cheap internet connection across the country). The teenagers who are not having knowledge of what is the CLASS THING, what is MUST WATCH and what is MUST NOT WATCH. And another reason must be the LOCKDOWN across the world.I have seen and liked all seasons of BREAKING BAD, PEAKY BLINDERS, GAME OF THRONES, SHERLOCK HOLMES, NARCOS, PRISON BREAK, PAATAL-LOK, SACRED GAMES, MIRZAPUR (Yes, I am Indian). This is for you to know which kind of person I am.Whenever any movie or series getting famous (if I don't know much about its Director or Actors), I ask my friends whether it is worth or not. And I think all of us do this. This series was also being popular, none of my friends had watched it and there was completed LOCKDOWN so I thought to give it a try.Even the first episode was disaster. The actors were not giving 100% dedication to their characters, I couldn't complete even the first episode. It was not going in proper direction.So this is only hype. I wonder how many less knowledgeable people are there across the globe. If you are used to watch classic series and movies, do not go for it.I REPEAT DO NOT GO FOR IT!!!",Money_heist

1909,born-naked-0,Bella Ciao,9/10,8 April 2018,"Just finished watching season 2 in a stretch and I want more of this. This is a refreshment to the audience. The cast is very mature in its acting, dialogues are crisp and the background score is icing on the cake.The script is epic and screenplay is brilliant which grasps you til the ea=nd with the nail biting drama. You will keep asking yourself 'What will happen next ?'
You will connect to each of the characters in one or the other way. I just can't end my review without mentioning Pedro Alonso who plays 'Berlin'. A standing ovation to this gentleman. I won't go into the detail but you will love and hate him at the same time.This is a must watch.

1913,nc-biehljo,"Logic holes, stupid characters and one witty heist",4/10,5 April 2021,"OK, so I watched until the first episode of season 3, and then had to stop because it was just too much.The series starts of well, an interesting concept, your suspension of disbelief (regarding the tonnes and tonnes of paper money they somehow want to get out there, purely regarding the impracticability of it, and the fact that there are serial numbers on those bills, making them easily worth not a whole lot) helps get this going.However, each of the characters constantly gets themselves in a bad situation due to idiotic decision making and then the consequences they would so desperately deserve they don't face.I don't know what the writers of this show were thinking with their stand-offs, people cocking their guns left and right, someone faces a gun from someone else, so of course this person just draws their gun, too. What even hold the gun up for, if you aren't shooting the person who you're threatening, when they are drawing their own weapon? Ridiculous.The police acts idiotic and amateurish, unrealistic gun battles do not end in deserving deaths for the perpetrators, but are a cheap means to (try and) generate tension.I give the show credits for keeping me hooked regarding how exactly everything (the heist) turns out, even though you kind of know what is happening.In conclusion: suspend your disbelief as much as you can, and you are left with a middling show with an interesting premise and silly characters.",Money_heist

Unfortunately the show continued on and on and on and on and........The velocity of story telling that at least covered the bad acting. Unfortunately the story telling slowed down more and more of the course of the run of this series.Season two and three could have been told in one season. Seasons four and five in half a season, but more later on the horribly bad Stallone style Rambo style non-story telling last part of this over stretched, over rated mess.Let's get on with the acting first and start with the worst excuse of an actor first; the professor, Alvaro Morte. The weakness of his performance is illustrative for the gliding scale of this show. His role got bigger, bigger and bigger over the course of the show. His underwhelming performance in terms of playing someone that actually has any form of intelligence, combined with his sack-of-mash potatoes charisma makes for a brilliant main character Netflix! Well done! Pedro Alonso, only decent actor in the whole show has a role for to small.Season 5:Let's keep the s-storm going and the money train going without delivering any quality content and stretch it as long as we can so a show that started decently will still attract more subscriptions but eventually will be remembered as the biggest flop ever. That seems like the one plan the director has had with this show, that's turning more into a C movies sequel. In the first half of season 5 we see the Rambo effect described above. In the first episode of the second episode season 5 we see Najwa Nimri whom just gave birth, out psychical the professor.Please stop this show and release me from ever having to see the same low quality performances from all these C,D,E, and F class actors.

It is like first 'story' (two first seasons) HAD to have nearly 20 episodes rather than make a proper cutting. Make a new cutting and reduce to 5-6 episodes. Then it would be an intense thriller.
Now it was more like 'when is something going to happen'.

1925,kyleshentonsax,Incredibly intriguing,10/10,25 April 2020,"This show is a non-stop roller coaster. I see a lot of negative reviews, however 'Money Heist' delivers time after time. The pacing is impeccable, each part of the story leading into another in a way that keeps you wanting more. The plot is thoroughly concise and is very satisfying to see unfold. As an English viewer; I find it utterly refreshing to see some great dramas from the continent. I found 'Money Heist' consistently addictive and always wanted more

especially Berlin. He has given the serie a special touch. Let him please return in season 2. That he is dead is not really sure yet. Doors can still be open to his return.
The story is simply good and exciting. If you start with the serie you want to finish the complete story in 1 time.Hats off for the Spaniards. Excellent work.

1929,tgs_enough,Downhill like mountain bike with their annoying characters and also overated.,4/10,22 March 2020,"Signed up just to write this comment.Season 1 is great with its mastermind robbery but it gets really annoying by tokio character keeps ruining everything with her improvisation in the following season. Not really best acting either.
My advise is to watch it as a white noise on your tv not for the thrill, let alone for the plot. You'll get annoyed and ended up doing house chores.

1931,animesh-dewan,Getting worse every season,2/10,22 September 2021,"Season 4 was a huge disappointment. Every episode just kept getting nuttier than the previous one and just when you thought it would not get worse, it did.I think only the first two seasons had any good writing and now its just a has-been show. Netflix should just drop it and not let it get any worse, but they won't if they can still make some money off the die hard fans.

1934,kadir-usta,Nice TV show that sometimes makes you angry. 6-7/10,7/10,26 March 2018,"I don't know if my impatience toward tv series in general will affect my review but I guess it will. Usually I don't like tv shows that are long especially when focused on one or few ideas and place! Like this show! The idea is nice and what they are trying to convey to the audience is interesting. But they keep repeating the same tactic like the thieves ""revolutionists"" are always a step ahead of the police when you think that they screwed up but you find that the professor thought of it too :O which became really stupid sometimes. Illogical. Some scenes and events are really silly and nonsense. Some characters are needles and some were really stupid like the big 2 guys. However, the show has some really amazing scenes. Would I recommend the show? Yes I would as a non-professional tv series with a catchy idea and an ending the audience will like, maybe love as I did! At least it's not too long hehe",Money_heist

I crave for intelligent heist triller for a very, very long time and just the 1st few reviews and the score and i was hooked. To my surprise this is nothing more ,but intelligent heist WANNABE. Plot is flawed on so many levels , the actions and the choices our characters made one after another along with the insultingly dumb conversations at the most unpropriate times just made it unwatchable for me. I tried , i tried really hard to not pay much attention to small things just for the sake of the general entertainment ,but u couldnt do it and im sorry but i feel like i have to be drunk to stop noticing so many things. If you like t owatch smart movies with twists and really complicated intriguing plots do yourself a favour and skip it cause it will hurt your intellect! If like i could assume from some of the reviews u are nott much into this and i never seen anything good and similar plot wise .. u might try it but then again u only need to watch and listen carefuly and if u possess half the intelligence of a monkey u wont be entertained at all. I am sorry for my review but someone had to say the truth. AND NO it is not subjective , what is DUMB and unbelievable is DUMB and unbelievable sorry.",Money_heist

Yeah, the inspector is idiot and is in violation of police protocols basically with every breath she takes, but if it's not her, there are other ridiculous, unthinkable ways the Professor gains crucial information. I'm not a police officer and even I understand that it's NOT OKAY to let ANYONE inside the building that you are currently investigating (House, where gang was getting ready for robbery), let alone have a stranger drive you there.

Looks like they were struggling to extend the episodes and which in turn doesn't look like a very good decision. And finally not a spoiler, but an alert to the people who are very curious like me : it's not the end of the heist, there will be one more season coming for this to end.Gist: It's again a wait for another season to follow to complete the heist, which is really sad to say the least and hence 3/10.

The story has so many loose ends, so many plot holes that creators are trying to fix in same episode, the story and flashbacks are put in conveniece of creators and it doesn't even pay off loose ends.

So the 4th season starts with Nairobi bleeding to death and then she has a perforated lung and then all of a sudden they are able to perform a surgery on her and take the bullet out and boom she survives it.
This series is too vulgar and not mentioning all the useless scenes. Every 5 minutes someone is yelling at someone and they have their gun pointed to their head. LOL
Not to mention the rest of the useless details and how the producers treat the audience as stupid.
Bottom line: Don't watch it

Just finished watching the first 7 episode within a day ü§£ It is not a show for the purist. It is not a perfect show! But, is it still worth watching? Yes, for the entertainment. It keeps you on the edge, you want to know what is going to happen next. It is one of those guilty pleasures like Game of Thrones or eating an extra cheese pizza. It has its low. The background story of each character gets a bit boring. The writers need to define each character, agreed. But, we are in a middle of a Heist! I thought the tempo keeps dropping here and there. But, overall it has that feel good feeling. Bunch of losers dreaming to get rich buy committing a crime. Most of them come out as amateur robbers and are careless and casual, they don't look like professional going about their business with absolute focus barring their.... Hush! Do not want to give away any spoilers. If you can overlook the imperfections, it is surely a show worth watching. You will fall in love with the characters. Let me know who is your favorite!

However, you just can't stop watching it!The action scenes are kind of fun and then just when you start drifting off during another extended (and unnecessary) sequence about what happened ten years ago the professor introduces yet another bizarre and unexpected plot twist and grabs your interest again.Definitely nowhere near a Breaking Bad epic.

The special effects are really good and it's a good and complete show, with bits of action, romance and comedy. The thing that bothers me the most is the intention, like making a bunch of criminals that literally kidnap and kill innocent people look like "" the good guys"". I get that it's from a revolution stand point and a critique to the system but they don't focus well enough on that for it to make sense.

1985,vagl_7,"Great idea, good acting, average creativity.",6/10,7 April 2020,"Well, usually when you watch these kind of movies, you start empathize all the parties, because if you are in this kind of situation you understand people need to act somehow to stay alive.
1. Arthuro was the weirdest persona, nobody could understand his role, although he kept creating a mess without being held responsible or at least to be tide up.
2. Nairobi keeps causing lots of trouble, which is definitely unrealistic; something like when they have to escape and there is a few minutes left, they are wondering around with the young guy.
3. Sometimes the group holds meetings, and at that point all the hostages are at the lobby without any surveillance, they could just press the button and open the door to go.
4. There to guards in front of the toilet door, and the hostages talking, using types, etc... and nobody notices.
5. The all movie is like puzzle, well thought although there small small stupid mistakes, that has nothing to do with the fact that ""it is just a movie"".There would be so many points to add up, however it is enough I guess. I stopped watching from the very beginning of the third season as I realized that because of that stupid young couple, something wired is about to happen.",Money_heist

1987,bubicabuba72,It should've ended a long time ago,8/10,21 April 2020,"I started watching this show before it came on Netflix. I really liked first 2 seasons (it was one season with 15 episodes actually).
It was suspenseful, well thought, thrilling.
It was nearly perfect.
But ever since Netflix got involved and audience became huge, the quality of the show downgraded. Finishing it after 2 seasons would've been perfect.
But no, they had to made more seasons to grab more money and ""satisfy"" the fans.
Well after finishing season 4 I am not satisfied at all.
So much plot-holes, unnecessary romance drama, flashbacks, irrealstic events...
And many characters became annoying to me.
Season 3 was decent, Season 4 disappointing, I don't wanna imagine how will season 5 turn out.
Maybe I won't even watch it. It's ridiculous that one heist lasts 3 seasons, when in fact the heist shouldn't have happened at all.

1989,mr11212,"Great show, way more drama than action",7/10,7 June 2020,"The show is awesome but the English voiceovers at times are not clear so captions are helpful. And the characters make mention of ""like in the movies"" WAY too many times. It's annoying and distracting. A couple of the actors aren't as good as the main ones and the side stories are sometimes drawn out too long. But overall this is a show I can enjoy but not good enough to binge watch. This is a soap opera with a twist that's all.
Furthermore all the moments when guns are drawn inside of the mint are useless because we know these people aren't killers and nobody's killing each other, especially fellow robbers.

I made it too far to quit now, but I agree with a previous reviewer about how these characters seem too incompetent to pull off a money heist. I suppose the writers also want you to feel they are good guys sticking it to the government without really wanting to hurt any innocents. Not sure how much longer this can keep up.

1996,marenovic_d,"The more you watch it, the worse it gets",5/10,7 November 2021,"First two seasons were great. Of course they had their own flaws but they were very entertaining, good written and made some sense.Seasons 3, 4 and 5 just ruined the show. Story is weak, characters not interesting at all, and they were acting stupid most of the times (making stupid choices). Some scenes were so unwatchable that made me think ""Why am I still watching this show?"" (like 5 people shooting at a guy from few meters distance and no-one hits him???). Also, scenes ""from the past"" where they show flashbacks from some previous heists were especially boring & painful to watch because one can tell they forced those scenes into the show just so that they could recast certain people.All in all -

After the massive success of first two parts Netflix invested more to make another season. Hence we got to watch part 3&4 about a new heist.We start this part from where we left it on part three; Nairobi shot to almost death, Lisbon caught and falsely executed to entrap Professor. Following which The Professor, filled with grudge and sorrow declaring this a war. So from a spectator's point of view it's a total mess, which we expected to recover this season.From the very first episode of part 4(The thumbnail of which is I guess ""Inspired"" by a very prominent picture/one of the many posters of Vertigo by Alfred Hitchcock which has absolutely nothing to do with story) we see that the healing of the mess has started with surgical procedure done to Nairobi, Professor as always managing his way out of the trouble and with them the story moves along.As like the first two/three parts of the show the acting, cinematography and editing stand out; on the contrary the quality of the script goes down only. The show was originally created by Alex pina, who overviewed the writing of the first two parts and some of the episodes of part three but the rest of part three and entire part four is mainly done by Ana Boyero, Luis Moya, Emilil Diez and several other writers.A major surgical procedure done just right by Tokyo with no professional to guide her, Palermo teaching an A grade assassin how to break free from a handcuff, Arturo harassing women at the midst of heist, messing up with military helicopter, a top grade police officer having tons of options in his hand just passing information to a known criminal, Alicia without even watching the CCTV footage finding out professor and most importantly no story development what so ever. These are some massive glitches in writing in this part of the show.To conclude, it's the same mess again; just like how we left it after part three and all we can do is wait for the next part to fix them up.",Money_heist

It starts with a cool idea, it introduce the story in an entertaining way but then face the burden of character development and story telling.This could have been an entertaining 5 episodes TV-show, instead it is a 15 episode mess followed by another season.The show is filled of plot holes and illogical reactions. It also use cliffhangers in the most infuriating way. Almost each episode ends with a dramatic situation that is defused instantly at the next episode start. It gives the feeling that nothing important ever happens. Worst, if feels like the show think the public is stupid and forgiving.On the other side the actors are doing very well and the direction is good too. The story is a total failure, I could not finish the two last episodes of season 1, even by skipping scene.",Money_heist
2014,Maximilian-Titus-Scholte,Season 4 upgraded my view on this from 7/10 to 9/10,9/10,7 April 2020,"The first 2 seasons start quiet different but amazing in its own way. I kinda disliked some of the romance and characters, especially the tryhard strong independent woman role.Season 4 was different, completely keeping me on my stupid treadmill for 130 minutes without break. so much tension i couldnt waste a minute doing smth else. At this season the serie shifted to a more aggressive and action style and i rly like that.

2015,amanmohammed,Overhyped. Dragging. Overrated.,1/10,11 April 2020,"This has to be one of the most overhyed show I've ever watched. There has to be some reason behind the hype, After watching 3 seasons of this. I can say there isn't any. One hiest is dragged on for 2 seasons. It's predictable in every way. A robbery which could have been shown in 2 episodes or so was dragged for 20+ hours.
Please don't waste your time on this. There are plenty of shows our there that are actually worth the time.
You aren't missing out on anything. If you ask me, it's better if you miss this hype train.

2020,baylott-43395,Gripping and thoroughly enjoyable,9/10,24 October 2020,"There are a lot of bad reviews; apparently these heists are unrealistic. Are you honestly telling people that these heists are unrealistic!? This is a TV show, it stretches the truth, that's what TV shows do. If you want realistic (and often drab), go and watch documentaries.These are very gripping series, you invest in the characters, even though they are ultimately the bad guys. Perhaps it is a soap opera as some of the 1 star and 3 star reviews suggest, however the characters are much more believable than the users leaving 1 star and 3 star reviews. As far as I'm concerned, bring on a another 2 series, and 2 more after that; it's infinitely more enjoyable and rewarding than most of the other franchises that go on for far too long.

2022,sumonpaulmufc,Worst tv series I have seen,1/10,13 May 2020,"This series got a high rating. So I thought let's check it out. My god how the hell people are even liking it! It is so overrated. Here are few points I picked up from first 7 episodes.
1) Professor makes the stealing looks like a heroic act. I mean how. They are not stealing but printing money, so what is that, charity!!!
2) The guys involved in the heist are so stupid. Two of them fell in love & now their love is more important than their mission. One father who spent most of his life in prison got panick attack knowing his son has murdered a hostage and almost compromised their mission. The son who is a 'hotshot' and used to 'bully people' fell in love with a hostage and could not kill her. (Yeah that's how the poor their writting is). It's nothing wrong for a criminal to have a heart but they have it too much, you will feel they are too good to be a criminal (but none of them are amateurs).
3) The police. They are the stupidest people I know. An inspector shares her mission information with her mother. She goes home & comes back like you are in a 9-5 job. She even dates during the mission. They let any people enter in their camp, no privacy at all. Even I could have fooled them.
Don't even talk about the acting and voice-overs. Apart from one or two people the acting is aweful. Please stay away from this show.",Money_heist

Cops are just shown as a band of morons, affairs between hijackers and hostages are quite ridiculous (as is also the affair between the professor and ladycop). But, above all that, the girl who plays Tokyo is absolutely insulting. Her acting is soooo bad I ended up fast forwarding when sh was on screen. it is really insulting.

2027,paiadude,Was going great but fell apart in the last episodes,5/10,12 October 2018,"Let me start by saying that I was loving this series a lot until about episode 5 of part 2 (on the Netflix cut of the episodes). There were problems with the plot before that like, for example, how an entire police force be so inept ? But you can accept some of these because, hey, it's a movie. 
But when Raquel realizes her lover is the professor and decides not to arrest him, the whole credibility of the series falls apart. And then she sinks lower and lower in stupidity until the very end. All while the inept police force doesn't arrest her and she is not even prosecuted for her crime of lettting the robbers get away. 
Add to this the fact that Tokyo manages to escape and come back to the mint. Two quite impossible feats.
The insane gun fights in the mint near the end where, again, the professional police SWAT team can seem to hit half protected robbers with a single bullet.
And the ending which glorifies the criminal acts that these robbers made instead of putting them in jail were they belong.
So my rating went from 10 after part 1 to close to 0 at the end. But I still gave it a 6 overall because of the great first part and the fact that I might be affected negatively by the fact that they weren't arrrested.",Money_heist

It would have worked as a spinoff, but it gives nothing to the main story.Problem 3. The main antihero is a psychopath. All good there, but when they later try to make us feel sorry for her? Its not working .. really... (sure, Dexter was a psychopath but he actually cared, or tried to, for the ppl around him) this woman is just not likable.)Problem 4. My favorite ---
Problem 5. The Corona probably f - kd up some of the production..So, season 1(1&2) get 9,5 stars. (7-10 stars on the individual episodes.)

This is, in a lot of ways, comparable to the behind the scenes journey of this failing Spanish saga. Netflix became the saviour of this once packed up two part series. The reason I am saying this is because it is clearly evident why it was failing in the first place. The direction is mediocre at best. The illogical thrill portrayed in the entire four parts is far from an art piece, it is instead comparable to Dwayne Johnson movie at best. The terribly designed filler intimate scenes can be described as Laboured. The use of logic in the screenplay is similar to the use of water in the running of an IC engine. The actors have a lot to work upon their skill in order to match the level of increasing fame they have received over the years. In the end it looks like Netflix played a big gamble by buying the show, and looks like it paid off!

There are reasons for the hype, the show is very good: unexpected and good written script, the caracters are incredibly real (in a fictional situation, of course), the actors superb, the aestetic awesome and those touches of black humor here and there, mixed with the tension and the twists.
Some people find aspects to criticize and maybe they are right but, I can't think of one single reason for not watching the show. Around 18 hours of pure entertainment that let you craving for more seasons (there are only two, it's a limited series) and, at the same time, with an enormous smile in your face for the ride.

The mind games between the police and Professor were exciting and wow-inducing. All the meticulous planning that they went through was amazing and kept you on the hooks.But the parts where they showed infighting between the thieves was way overdone. Everyone was pointing guns at everyone else, and completely botched the beauty and preciseness of the plan...and made the audience cringe.And Season 3 and 4 overdid all the internal discussions and interactions - there was much less time dedicated to the interaction between the police and thieves. If they could somehow edit out most of the non-heist related planning (example: the wedding scenes with Denver, and the stupid dialogues over lunch, etc), and the stupid infighting during the heist (round robin of ""now I am in charge"", Arturo scenes, the whole Gandia fighting), those seasons could also have been great.My recommendation to other viewers - do watch this series as this is probably the best of heist planning you will ever see (better than Mission Impossible movies). Just fast forward meaningless scenes showing personal interactions.",Money_heist

The story portrays a man known as ""Professor"" who comes up with an extremely perfect plan of a heist by assembling some criminals who excel in some fields. The heist includes taking over one of the largest banks in Spain and bringing out huge amount of money from it but whose money is being stolen that is the biggest surprise. The events taking place inside the bank with the hostages and the ""robbers"" alongside the situations being handled by the Professor and the cops and intelligence outside the bank has created a masterpiece whose final outcome is still left to be revealed in the upcoming seasons.

Made me realize so many things about myself and others and helped me to pick myself up and believe in myself and, also I realized my worth. I know, it might not make sense in what I'm saying but... I just want to say that watching this show brought back to me my old self, the truself. And the Bella Ciao song just hits you to the core. Absolutely Love it.

It's gripping and doesn't let you down for one second from beginning to end. I was sad to see it end. They say there might be a sequel in 2019. Let's see. One thing I found disturbing is that IMDB had no timely updates and reviews! Why is that? It's one of the most acclaimed TV series internationally. Even until today, not all episodes are registered adequately. Please fix that for the records.

Of course it will suck if you watch is dubbed, dubbed is for children who can't read so there you have that. They say it's a soap opera but it's not, it's a great heist series with loads of humor and romance, who doesn't like that? They are saying soap opera probably because it's in Spanish and no other reason than that. They say it has no logic or common sense but they are robbing the bank of Spain so yeah in real life that's not logical because it wouldn't happen but this is TV for gods sake and if someone were to rob the bank of Spain in real life, this is how they would do it so it has plenty of logic.
This is one of the best series I've ever seen and it baffles me that anyone would say bad things about it. It is completely original and you have never seen anything like it. I laughed a lot while watching this, I cried a lot, I was on edge a lot and couldn't stop watching it. I'm very happy they decided to make more season because I wanted more and more and more!

But they keep dragging this moribund story on and on, that survives only thanks to the artificial hype generated around characters.Plot twists are predictable or illogic, tension never reaches a climax since climaxes are everywhere.For God's sake, end this suffering already and leave us (and Berlino) in peace.

2074,shikharsrivastavaon,"Perfect blend of suspense, thrill, emotion and drama.",8/10,3 April 2020,"LaCasa da Papel/Money Heist is one of the best shows out there. It's engaging from the minute you set in the first episode. The pacing of the show is just perfect. You won't feel even an episode wasted. All episodes are high on suspense always keeping you on the edge and will keep you hooked and longing for more.
Having a brilliant story and plot the main highlight of the show is it's characters. You'll have give it to the writers for writing such amazingingly flawed characters. The characters are layered and have amazing growth and arcs. You get so invested in the characters that you start feeling their laughs and their pain and you start rooting for them. You might even cry when one of them dies. And trust me the stakes are very high, they will die, even your favourite ones can.
The show has a unique way of story telling by parallelly showing current and flashback scenes which makes it even more engaging and makes the characters and their actions relatable. There are valid explanation behind all the big smart actions or plans which sometimes are little hard to buy but still serves the purpose.
The episodes are full of suspense and thrill and are high on emotions as well.
The show is extremely high on symbolism as well. How the Dali Mask, Red Colour and Resistance and of course bella ciao is used is extremely remarkable. It adds up even more layers to the story.
The cast is spot on and acting is decent.Overall its a must watch.
Totally binge-worthy.",Money_heist

2088,groves-04050,How many plot holes can you fit into one story?,1/10,17 March 2018,"Let me start by saying, I think like many others, I was duped into watching this by its high IMDB rating. And because of this series I am 100% convinced that Netflix is paying people to give this show a high rating. I understand that people's tastes vary, however, if you enjoy stories with countless plot holes, unlikable/irritating characters, bad acting, pointless monologues, and complete nonsense, then this is a must watch. In fact, the only reason I watched the whole series, was because of how ridiculous it was. It frequently sent me into fits of laughter.This did have the potential to be fairly interesting, yet it seems the writers went out of their way to produce complete nonsensical drivel. The story focuses on a group of supposedly highly experienced/intelligent robbers, who plan to take over The Royal Mint of Spain, in order to print and steal vast sums of money, over a two weeks period. Yet, this group of professionals couldn't be more incompetent. They spend five months prior to the robbery, in a boarding school style setting, run by an equally incompetent professor. Not only are they treated like children, but they also do a good job of acting like children. During the robbery, each of them take turns in making completely pointless mistakes, putting the entire heist in jeopardy. There are many boring monologues between the characters, which offer little substance. A good series would normally have at least one likeable character, either good or bad, where the audience can follow them on a journey and become engrossed in the story. Unfortunately there are no such characters existing in this series. The writers attempt to use the 'sex sells' approach throughout, hoping that the audience will be enticed by random cleavage shots, and hilarious sex scenes.The lead investigator/hostage negotiator was what really took the biscuit for me. Throughout the series she constantly makes wrong decisions, taking her lunch breaks in a nearby tapas bar, where at one point, she even drinks wine in the middle of her working day. This women is irrational, unstable, and appears to only care about getting laid. Not only has she had a 15 year affair with her closest colleague (who is married), but she also manages to bed the professor, after suspecting him of being in charge of the heist. The plot holes are really endless, and I could go on...If you enjoy watching high quality productions, then stay well clear of this. On the other hand, if you fancy watching laugh out loud rubbish then get stuck in!",Money_heist

If you want to have something on in the background while you're working then this will surely do, other than that I wouldn't waste my time. It's just a bunch of done before action movie shticks combined together with a lot of drama in between. Some of the unrealistic scenes and English dubbing will make you laugh if that's what you're looking for. Would've been a 4 but Ursula Corbero gives it a boost.

Season 1 started surprisingly good and had everything needed for success: amazing plot, new actors, a different language, diversity, everything! And that's the reason it was amazingly succesful.
Season 2 was good enough, not as the first one but nice to watch.
Season 3 was the first sign that somebody tries to make money out of the dead horse. Plotholes, bad acting, people keep repeating phrases, irrelevant scenes...You could easily understand that something is going wrong.
As for season 4...? I think it was the final shot for the tv show.

2101,heloisaduarte-16343,Amazing show with too much romance,9/10,29 September 2018,"The plot twists throughout the show are really good because you may expect them but not in the way they happen. There are some characters like Tokio or Denver who can be really frustrating as their only focus are their love interests and that clouds their judgement and actions, especially Tokio's, to the point where it seems that she just doesn't care about anything else. Actions are too influenced by irrational feelings and that's why Berlin is one of my favorite characters because he's able to follow the plan and doesn't mess up too often or for stupid reasons. Nairobi is another favorite as she sticks to the plan, is tough when needed and is able to keep the gang together. The professor is incredible, even though his love affair with the inspector is a mess. The show really keeps you excited for what's going to happen next and it has great hidden messages and morals. La Casa de Papel is a nice show if you compare it to other very meh shows around right now!!
Cons: too much feelings and romance for a criminal show, hence characters behaving like amateurs sometimes.
Pros: lots of action, clever plot twists and well designed characters.",Money_heist

2103,abinashdeepak-84725,Brilliant Masterpiece,10/10,26 January 2019,"I don't usually write reviews but some of the reviews here made my blood boil. What is it with these people ? Is it a case of rivals who are jealous of the success of the show ?Every negative review says holes in the plot but they don't say what it is lol..Anyways, the plot is genius. If you like the Hollywood movies like ocean 13 etc, this is on a different level altogether. The acting is good, the screenplay is super, the way each knot is untied is great, soundtrack excellent. Romance between the 2 main characters is totally engrossing. I mean someone actually came up with that while the heist is ongoing ? 10 for that itself.The haters can hate all they want, but this show is phenomenal. Huge rating with that many reviews is a proof.

2104,limazika,Only Season 1 was great,4/10,26 February 2021,"Season 1 was the right combination of a clever heist plot, drama, action, and a love story. Season 2 was still okay as a follow-on.
But Season 3 and 4 were a complete waste of time. New characters, endless love twists, and complete disregard to common sense led to its fall.

The main drawback(minor one) was the dubbing. Some voices did not match with the characters. I found Birlin out standing as well as the Professor. How I wanted them to succeed(well that was the whole idea as per the professor)Remindes me of The David Baldachi book called 'The Winner' I was rooting for the bad guy!!

2107,ymomchil,Last 3 seasons are painful to watch.,3/10,25 September 2021,"First 2 were fine. Intersting idea with interesting characters. You could just ignore the plot holes. Maybe a bit stretched, but it was still a nice show. And from there the last three seasons are just taking advantage of the fanbase's investment in the story for money. The hole show was butchered. I have never seen anything that stupid. I'd rather go watch indian soap opera. It's actualy insane how little sense it makes now. I am so frustrated that I've spent so much time watching this show because it has certainly not been a pleasant watch. Especially the last season. It's like a parody. If anyone is reading my rant and has not watched the last three seasons, please don't.

2109,JoeMarq994,"Overrated as hell, Seasons 3 and 4 (Part 2) not worth watching",1/10,26 June 2020,"Season 1 was pretty interesting. The characters invested me and I enjoyed seeing how the hostages and the criminals interacted with each other and how each criminal has a different backstory. But then it became a boring soap opera, and these so called ""professional"" criminals started doing the most stupid things possible to each other. Even the police showed utter incompetence at the simplest of actions. Are we supposed to like Tokyo? Everything she does is backed by no logic whatsoever and I could not stand any scene she was in. Seasons 3 and 4 were a huge step down. The fact that half of these characters agreed to another heist in Part 2 completely baffles me, and it just turned into a soap opera set in a bank. People are hyping up this show and my friend calls this the ""Best show on Netflix"" and I just don't understand it. It's strange how this show was translated into English as ""Money Heist"" but is actually a soap opera masquerading as a heist show.

2110,davyjordens,Ridiculous plot,4/10,31 January 2019,"The plot of the series is intelligent and promising during the first few episodes, but after a while the story becomes more and more ridiculous: dozens of highly trained special police forces seem to be the dumbest and clumsiest police in the universe, firing thousands of bullets without hardly ever hitting any clear and unprotected targets, while the robbers never miss a single shot and are always 50 steps ahead. So ridiculous it become frustrating.

The narrative is fantastic with often going back and coming forth in timeline. All the characters are delved deep into creating an overall impact to the whole story. 
The plot has enough twists to keep you hooked from the first minute of the show. All the actors have played their roles with equal elan. 
Must Watch !!

Although, the conversations between the characters, which are in love, seem to repeat over and over again, which is - sorry 'bout that - quite annoying. It's therefore the only negative aspect, I can report. The rest is purely fantastic: The idea, the acting, the directing, the visualization...

2134,palle-47036,Soap opera disguised as heist movie,3/10,6 August 2020,"Silly throughout.. First episodes caught my attention, but quickly I realised that the plot had run out and that it was basically a soap opera from here. If you're looking for any kind of entertaining/impressive action, this isn't it. Even the crime element is ruined by unrealistic convenience and the silly decisions made by pretty much every single character in the movie. All we're left with is nonsensical drama. I binged the first 6 episodes and then skipped to the last in order to get to the ending. Don't get fooled by the hype. This series is for mindless Netflix-zombies, not for actual people with a mind for movies.

2139,vivekgoyal-48332,Enjoyable till you start realizing how flawed it is,5/10,21 May 2018,"This was the first Spanish show I was watching and initially i got really hooked to it. 
What you expect from a heist show is the robbers showing a great amount of intelligence and planning to outwit the cops. Yes, there was a lot of planning involved and the main man behind it ""The Professor"" was a likeable character but slowly you start realizing that the cops and the intelligence team handling the operation have been shown so incompetent. The head of the cops team, Raquel Murillo is one of the lead cast in this show. But a few of her actions in the show might leave one surprised as to how foolish and ineffective the cops are. You start to wonder whether the heist is being successful because of the intellect of the con team or rather due to unprofessionalism of the cops.
Season 1 is still watchable but I thought that Season 2 was disastrous. Things that were happening defied logic and by the later half of the second season, the show was literally dragging. There are many loopholes in the logic and methods adapted by the police to stop the heist. 
I cant recall having watched any other show in this genre (except from the movie Oceans Eleven which i liked) but I would suggest giving this TV series a miss.",Money_heist

But then you notice the reviews are paid by Netflix, all phrasings very similar, no effort, all 10 points. The series would've had a lot of potential, interesting theme, BUT either this was made for teenagers or the creators have ignored one major fact: mastermind criminals who have been training for months aren't loose cannons after only 48 hours, having sex with everybody, dwelling on their personal problems, hostages don't develop a Stockholm syndrome in 48 hours, leading police detectives don't go for dates (with criminals!) during a massive hostage drama, and police officers don't turn into drunks and commit suicides in 48 hours. It's just so hilarious that all these people behave like the hostage drama had been going on for weeks and months. One of the funniest things is that the gang takes the eyeglasses of of of the police officers and installs a bug on the frame in front of the police officer, and he doesn't notice anything!! It doesn't help that everybody is overacting so much it hurts. I suppose this was meant as a comedy or a thriller for teenagers. I'm kind of angry that they ruined a good idea this way.",Money_heist

Especially with the twist in the story-line that goes in favour of both the robbers and the police, this series is really something you can waste time on during this lock down. The last few episodes of season 1 might feel a little slow but you're going to keep watching it till the end until you can finally finish season 2, because that's where things get so wonderfully arranged.

Well, not to mention beautiful Spanish people who speak one of the sexiest languages in the world.Overall, the writing is simply superb with minor flaws which seem to be more abundant after the Netflix takeover. (In the 3rd season, there's more irrelevant social commentary dialogue that is seemingly due to America's obsessive PC culture)Finally, I will keep watching until its final part as the first two did such an extraordinary Job of building relationships with the main characters that I refuse to let go. Besides, I have to see if the Professor gets out alive and if Nairobi makes it out of the bank of Spain, right?PS. It has its flaws but the pros highly outweigh the cons.",Money_heist

2158,sineaddragomir,The series for dummies,1/10,25 November 2018,"What is this??? This series has absolutely 0 credibility. The script must have been written by a bunch of 10 years old teens (they will forgive me), full of non-sense and totally incoherent. Characters are as convincing as dummies, with no past, no depth, no real personality. It looks like they were just taken out of a manga or borrowed from a cartoon, for the sake of their supposed coolness. This is a cardboard series. If you like being a fool and be treated as one, just watch and enjoy.

2160,mariaallanta,the show is problematic,6/10,5 January 2019,"It has a good plot and all but on the other hand, it's got almost all known crime genre Clich√© and it feels though the script is written so that they could fit in properly those clich√©s to fit the plot. I didn't feel any connection with the character and didn't care if they lived or died. it's too focused on Tokyo and doesn't let space to show the complexity of the other characters. too summer it all up, this show is just another crime show that tries to seem sophisticated and fails to do so.

2166,baumgartner_heuer,What is this nonsense...,1/10,30 January 2019,"It starts off great and then gets worse and worse.
The Professor is THAT almighty that the whole show is boring as hell. First I really thought - no joke - that this is a fan-fiction the Professor wrote about himself as he is absolutely flawless, knows everything, is allowed everywhere, seduces the most important woman in the show without problems (even it is said that he is completely helpless in those situations) It is so... frustrating and bad, it kills every suspension.Everything that happens always swings in favor of the criminals, mostly because of the Professor who resolves any problems within seconds and never, never, never gets any problems. He is always on the perfect spot for everything he wants to accomplish. And it aaaalways works out, it is so bad.But the most annoying thing is that this show really wants us to believe that the bad guys are the good ones. Women falling in love with them even they're risking other hostages lives. But lets not forget: They terrorized 67 people with great fear, giving them mental scars for live, forced a woman into sexslavery(!), risking health and mind of so many people. They threatened them, they put them in danger, they tortured them!
AND THEN - no joke - it takes one sentence(!) from Berlin in an Interview to bring ALL People around the world on their side? That is insulting for ALL people who ever were in such situations.
Those people would even make a show about a concentration camp in Nazi-Germany into an all funny-Nazi-Mess...",Money_heist

This season was just a mass of irrelevant fillers that did absolutely nothing for the plot and action scenes that were so unrealistic. Not to mention the inconsistency in the characters? Cliche relationship dramas to kill time, a military assassin that somehow couldn't figure out how to get out of hand cuffs but was able to dodge 100 bullets fired in open air, the professor and Lisbon brought absolutely nothing to the table until the last 30 minutes, Nairobi died twice for audience reaction, and the transgender who was introduced took no part in anything.

With dumb logics , a heist is still in the running , fine and smooth over two seasons. From Tokyo starting to wage a war to get back Rio and dumping him later to Arturo drugging women to take their advantages as a hostage himself is just ridiculous.Palermo releasing Gandia with a dislocated thumb and yet the most overpowered character in that condition.Dead Berlin doesn't have a much to do yet he is seen just for audience pleasure.Same ways, predictable plots and dumb logic like how an entire nation doesn't know their army birds all just makes Money Heist a cliche of La Casa e Papel.Although some great soundtracks like the Gravita and some brilliant acting by the cast and Alvaro Morte and Rodrigo de la Sarna should be lauded.

2176,atulp-36663,all characters play this role by hearts,10/10,3 September 2021,"A spanish television series which gained world wide popularity. After that Netflix acquired global streaming rights. It is full of drama,thrill,romance. The series is full of mind games and fine strategies. The series received several awards. There is 2 parts which is of 8 episodes each in first season which is about robbery of The Royal Mint of Spain.In the first look of this robbery gang we assume that they are robbers but after sometime they will actually become heroes. There are some situation where you must cry. Police Or government did several things wrong to them but they did nothing wrong even having so much guns etc they used those but no one killed by them. For so many reasons of heroic things they become idols and get support from public.Now comming to each character of money heist starting with then robbers-
1. Tokyo- she is strong enough to handle any situation but innermost she is also emotional.2. Nairobi- she is most caring person in the gang she can understand everyone from any gang members to any hostages.3. Moscow- a lovely character we can see in him. Also a lovely father he is.4. Rio- first of all he has a lovely smile, anyone fall in love with this smile. He has super knowledge about technology. Also boyfriend of Tokyo.5. Denver- another very touching character and touching smile he has. üòÇ son of Moscow, relationship between father and son is heart touching.6 & 7. Helsinki- a big man but soft hearted. He is with his brother, Oslo in this series. Brother was died in season 1.8. Berlin- last but top most character is Berlin of the gang, he has a cool mind to execute all situation. He is a fighter through out the season 1.Now comming to the other characters-
1. Inspector - who is doing her job but there is something ""In the end love is a good reason to everything fall apart"".2. Monica- secretary of director of Royal mint of Spain. In heist he and Denver fall in love.3. Arturo- Director of Royal mint and was boyfriend of Monica. People love this character so he is returned to the next season also.Now comming to the main character,
Professor- he mastermind of the plan and organise the plan so finely. He fall in love with inspector. He planned everything so preciously that ultimately won over all bad situation. He came with a epic twist in every time when needed.I must say there are some quotes in this series that actually meant a lot. One of them -
""When someone is in love, they look through rose-tinted glasses. Everything's wonderful. They transform into a soft teddy bear that's smiling all the time.""
I'm not telling the story. I'm just giving a touch of this series so who are not watched till now I suggest watch the series in this lockdown time and after one season you automatically watch next season's parts without any influence.""Una mattina mi sono alzato

2185,shuseinn,Tokyo biggest loose end,7/10,12 May 2020,"My opinion may not be popular but I found many loose ends in some scenes for example such professional assassin like G√°ndia didn't know for himslef how to escape handcuffs or how did Berlin and Palermo know all the details about the gold chamber or why Tokyo is just killing everything she touches she caused Moscow's death she could have caused Berlin's either and she started arguing with Palermo for nothing just girlish boss mind and ultimately caused Nairobi's death, though Professor ridiculously still defends her why really ? Others like Berlin his brother or Palermo did minor mistakes but professor got mad at them but he never get sad about the casualties Tokyo costs with her stupid stubborn fights against team leader she even caused her boyfriend's death and Rio's torture, still many loose ends and boring repetitives like Alicia acting exactly like Raquel or Pina only shows stupid things to kill good characters and more stupid things to keep awful characters like Tokyo alive",Money_heist

2197,gaborbence,"Could be good, but...",3/10,13 May 2020,"(I only could watch the first season, everything written is only applies for that)Money Heist could be a good piece, if they make it a movie series, or a short series.The base story is good, but it doesn't have enough content to fill up a whole series so they decided to go the path where they write stupid twists and conflicts to make up the screen time.Some characters are out of place, annoying kids who doesn't contribute anything to the heists succes, no way any masterplan would involve them. Any storng-enough individual could learn using powertools in five months, why would bring an older man just for that?The small thing that bothers me most is the CSi syndrome, where they want to show their technology as fantastic, way too advanced. They do impossible things most of the time. This applies to logic too, the police every time assumes everything right from the smallest information drop. ""Blurry image? Enhance. There is a face. We know everything about them now."" and so on.TLDR: Bad writing, bad directing, bad characters and (maybe) bad acting.Why it got the 3 stars:
The picture is very good. The camerawork, the lighting, the props, the clothing, the locations/sets (except the abandoned road felt out of place/""cheap"" at the heist's beginning) and the sound is flawless.Way to watch: The english dub ridiculous, set the language to original and the subtitles to english (cc).Based on the other reviews, which say that the first two seasons was the better, I DO NOT RECOMMEND watching Money Heist to anyone like me, who demands logic in a story. Do yourself a favour and save those hours for something worthy.",Money_heist

2199,gunjan-99694,My review of the Money Heist -- Is it a series worth watching? Absolutely. Is it relevant? Sufficiently.,8/10,29 April 2020,"La casa da papel, or known by its English name Money Heist, has been impossible to miss, with red jumpsuits and Dal√≠ masks popping up everywhere on social media. It's not surprising then, that it became the most-watched non-English show on Netflix.Initially, I was sceptical of the show. Would it be just another heist series with a predictable plan and some expected characters? But it turned out to be a little more than that for the creators took a classic heist story and redefined it completely. Yes, there were expected characters but with many unexpected turns to them. The 'Professor' crafted a masterplan not for robbing a bank, but for printing their own money inside Spain's Royal Mint.It is a quintessential Spanish drama. Rather than the cool, organised and technology-based drama you would expect from let's say, British shows, here, the focus is on the minds and the hearts. It's all about the meticulous planning that has gone behind the heist. To put it simply, it is more passionate and more human.But what made me love the show was the political theme running not-so-subtly alongside the main narrative. The robbers call themselves the revolution and their red jumpsuits are a clear choice drawn from socialist colours portraying blood and struggle. Even the Dal√≠ masks are not a random choice for Dal√≠ was known to express anti-capitalist sentiments in many artworks. The catchy song, Bella Ciao is a borrowed anthem from Italian protests and the corruption and hypocrisy of government organisations are targeted over and over again throughout the four seasons.Yes, I agree that the fourth season was not as thrilling, as exhilarating and as entertaining as the first two seasons. If you really just want a quick watch, you can stop after the second season because the second heist seems like a hollow imitation of the first. We miss Berlin even more when he's replaced by his weak replica, Palermo. The Professor loses his charm every time he's defeated by the police and the heist itself seems to be lacking in motive. But if you've been close to the characters like I have, you'll understand that this is not the characters growing weaker-they're simply changing and characters don't always evolve to be stronger versions of themselves but sometimes, just more real ones.Is it a series worth watching? Absolutely. Is it relevant? Sufficiently. At a time when we are witnessing anti-system protests all over the world and in India, and at a time when these protests seem more necessary than ever before, these revolutionary characters are much more likeable than heartthrobs in rom-coms. If nothing else, you'll end up cheering for the revolution to win and perhaps, longing for a cool, city name for yourself.",Money_heist
2200,yousefaltayeh,It become really bad,1/10,6 September 2021,"When I finished season 2 I gave it 10 stars because it was really amazing. Then, everything changed.The story for season 3 onwards is really bad and it damaged the full series. Netflix really destroyed the show.I cannot give it 10 stars anymore. So I will give it 1 only so they understand their huge mistake.

2209,James0112,An overrated show with annoying characters,1/10,4 July 2019,"Sure, the idea of the show is smart and entertaining: a bunch of elite criminals working together to rob billions of dollars. Some of the characters such as Berlin are professional and smart, which is good for the plot. It could have been a great series. But the show went downhill after Tokyo's relation with Rio is introduced. Their love is not reasonable at all and Tokyo kept using love as an excuse to ruin the plan of the entire team, putting everyone in danger but did not pay for her mistakes. Besides, there are just so many plot holes in the show that I don't want to spoil here. The police are unbelievably dumb and useless as they dealt with the criminals in stupid and inefficient ways. Many of the characters in the show does not help develop the plot but just annoy the audience so much, one of them being Tokyo who is so immature and arrogant which kept bringing trouble to the whole team. The actions of some characters are brainless and the show simply doesn't deserve such a positive rating. I would have given it a better rating if not for the vexing characters and plot holes. The show is polluted by undeveloped and sudden emotions and love between the characters.",Money_heist

IN SEQUENCE!
Undoubtedly, seasons 3-4 were less successful then 1st and second! But episodes still were stressful and terrific! Team had got 2 brilliant opponents - Sierra and Gandia. And their opposition was really nervous! Plan was not ideal and it was the main distinction from seasons 1-2 and it was interesting!
Secondly. For everyone, who think that is soap opera! If you wanted jejune cold blooded heist - maybe this show is soap for you! But it has lively and emotional characters who are only humans and can make mistakes!
ALL IN ALL, it is a fantastic show!",Money_heist

2221,cyrillhaenni,The most stupid Spanish Police and Superheros,3/10,22 July 2019,"Very frustrating movie, following typical unrealistic storyline. Robbers have superhero strengths, all planned out, professor who is a martial arts ninja while the police is led by the most stupid and unprofessional inspector ever seen. She never is at the site of the robbery, only deals with personal problems, does everything on her own and is a cry baby. In real life, nobody would give such a person the responsability of chief inspector. Finally when she catches the professor and he walks away, why she doesnt shoot him in the foot. The actors playing Tokio and Nairobi are not bad but the storyline sucks. Police wouldnt stay on stand by if kidnappers behave so strange, dont have any demands, deal with explosives, start shootings with the police, let the dictators set all terms, and hostages start disappearing. Also hostages working that happily for the robbers while treated like dogs is not realistic. Also the idea that the public supports and has sympathy for the robbers is a lame idea. Its hard to watch but this movie sucks big time. Worst actor: The inspector Raquel.",Money_heist
2222,stripcw24,Mind blown repeatedly.,10/10,24 July 2019,"This show is an unrivaled masterpiece. I want to give it a 12/10. I found it on a complete whim and was drawn in immediately. If subtitles aren't your thing, fear not, you'll forget they're even there halfway through the first episode. The acting is superb, the storytelling is insanely wonderful and the number of left turns this thing takes will literally make your head explode. i can only hope a part 4 is in the works. I want more and more and more of this, please.

Almost zero progress in an entire season, pointless and endless flashbacks. OK guys, we all liked Berlin but you decided to kills him, get over it, you can't bring him back in every episode to capitalise on his popularity.Third season was mediocre at best and then season four happened! Oh dear, what a comedy! Naked Gun at its best! Hostages that rape other hostages, transexuals trying to create plot twists (unsuccessfully), a moron (Rio) who allow a guy with skills of Rambo, Chuck Norris, Bruce Willis and Arnold Swargeneger combined to walk into a panic room that could also serve as weapon depository for a small army unit! And then we go beyond that to Avengers universe! Yes, you can see a single guy avoiding hundreds of bullets shot from 5 meters!

What we will see on the screen is an inept attempt to copy an idea. Several months of robbery planning take their head by stupid mishaps. Errors that nobody would make after planning for several days. Artificially generated problems. And the scene where the hostage acquires a weapon without a magazine, reloads and targets the attacker. ü§£ embarrassment.

2262,dragisabratanovic,Season 5 biggest disappointment ever,2/10,7 September 2021,"I'm so angry and sad for this series, it could be one of the greatest of all time, and instead it became classic Spanish soap telenovela. First season was mind-blowing, second was also great, third became average, while forth and fifth were big disappointments. I'm sad that creators had more desire for money than to end it in proper way for fans. No new ideas, telling already told stories, action scenes persists only with gun machines and grenades, big logic mistakes. If I could, I would give a zero grade.

The development of the characters, the music and atmosphere, the messages.. all these elements have created one of the best series I've ever seen on tv.
I liked the psychological close-ups and back & forths, that allowed me a deeper dive to characters, I liked how the honesty and the ambiguous nature of humans were portrayed on controversial characters, (Berlin=the machist/ethic hero, Arturito= the convencional honest/dishonest want-to-be hero, Helsinki= the loyal-unti-the-end hero, Tokyo= the unpredictable atomic bomb of the gang with her emotional wake up moments, Ariadna= the frightened want-my-life-and-your money lover of Berlin that stood by him until his end as promised, etc)All the characters, beautifully painted make a unique mosaic, a colourful kaleidoscope, an emotional rollercoaster, where the mainstream perception of good/bad loses its density, and values as: honesty, integrity, loyalty and love are brilliantly enlightened,",Money_heist

This has been much better than many of the recent Hollywood series' released in recent years. Acting is good but the voice overs seemed odd at times. Maybe it added to the enjoyment of the series.

2276,swayingbruno,Bad voice overs.,9/10,17 January 2020,"Enjoyed series only thing that spoilt it was the English voices they used,was like watching an old karate film from 60's and 70's.I normally wouldn't watch it for that reason alone but it had me gripped early on,so give it a go I think you will be surprised.

2277,virtusvincit,Starts decent but then complete lack of logic takes over...,3/10,2 May 2020,"I was completely hooked at the start of the first season. Unfortunately, the donkey like logic manifested itself early through out the show.Perhaps its the 50 armed guards whose aim is worst than stormtroopers. Perhaps its because of Tokyo breaking into the bank for the dumbest reason while everyone else is trying breaking out. Perhaps its because of the hostages plotting their escape a meter away from the robber whom must certainly be blind and deaf to not see what is happening. Perhaps its the cringe-worthy and overdone love scenes. If I were to write out the flaws in season 3 and 4, this review would turn into a never ending story.TLDR: It starts off as a decent show, but the lackluster logic dwindles this show to a level that can compare to none other than the last season of Game of Thrones.",Money_heist

I have no reservations towards mindless entertainment but the sheer audacity of the writers to pull anything off from their hat under the pretext of a mastermind professor for me, is ridiculous.

2284,almapm-50980,So Many Things Wrong with the Plot!,1/10,10 April 2020,"Season 1 was good and somehow plausible, but I pushed myself to finish season 2; and I'm absolutely not going to watch the rest as the writer/writers insult their audience by considering them gullible and/or action-junkie imbeciles! The following is just a few instances of what's wrong with the series:1. Abusing the song Bella Ciao to glorify a bunch of murderers and criminals as heros! Partisans fought for their country, its people and freedom, they didn't fight for their personal gain/money, they didn't take innocent people as hostages and mentally (and quite often in the series, physically) torture them!
2. Raquel was supposed to be the best chief of police in Spain and yet she was too stupid to take the guy somewhere out of the town to interrogate rather than arresting him right away! She was also too weak of a character to shoot him when she was given a second chance -in the legs, for instance- and let him drive off in her own car!
3. Angel lost his faith in the system in just less than 5 minutes? Monica risked her own and others' only chance of freedom over a stupid crush? What was the significance of the scene Nairobi boosting Alison's confidence when she was a passive hostage throughout S1&2 and not showing any courage? Was that merely a filler, like many other unnecessary scenes?
4. Is the Spanish police force this incompetent, for real?! They couldn't shoot Tokyo's motorcycle all the way she was driving through!
5. The police had several opportunities to infiltrate through the ceiling without breaking a glass or making any noise (e.g. cutting the glass at night like in Mission Impossible movies); even during multiple occasions of noisy exchanges and events when the heisters were distracted! 2-3 rangers could take down 5 criminals, especially if finished them quietly and separately (as they were scattered across the place most often), given that Oslo and Moscow were down, or when Oslo was gone and Tokyo under their custody.
Moreover, the characters are not charismatic and definitely not loveable! Do the writers seriously expect people to root for/relate to any of them?",Money_heist
2285,niioffeidodoo,A masterpiece,10/10,6 April 2020,"This series is just so masterclass.Every episode is full of suspense.It makes you believe as what happening is real and if you were in the shoes of the police you were going to do just what they did.Big Ups to Alex Pina for such a wonderful piece.Cant wait for Season 5.

2298,gammbs1,Had potential but was unbearable to watch,1/10,31 March 2020,"Money heist had a good first episode filled with a potential good story, good character introduction, good acting, great visuals but left a bad taste in my mouth because of the ending of the episode when the female lead character took matters into her own hands and compromised the plan because of her lover who is also with her all while she is being introduced to the viewer as someone who just a few days back lost the love of her life in a heist. In the same episode? The romance felt forced and rushed. Then in the second episode. It turns out that her lover didn't get shot and she compromised the whole thing because of someone she just met and he didn't even get shot. Damn that's stupid. But thankfully she didn't compromised the plan very much cause she can't aim while being a professional. Next on, the forced couple fights while a hostage seizes the opportunity to take her phone not to call someone but to delete a nude. Yeah right, to delete a nude while being taken hostage. Anyways through plot magic the police hacks in these milliseconds her phone camera and has a livefeed from the room and catches the main female leads lover while he rushed to grab the hostages phone. The police finds out who he is. And the plan gets more compromised. In episode three, the mastermind behind the plan orders to find the phone from which a colleague got identified. The main female leads lover eventually confessed that he himself was to blame. And his colleagues rightfully beat him up because it's the second time he and his forced love with main female lead compromised the plan. Then the, in my opinion, maniac and not at all professional main female lead takes matters into her own hands again and shoots the cameras which serve the actual mastermind of the operation. Because she is a PROFESSIONAL. That's when I stopped watching.And don't get me wrong. I like that their plan is kinda failing. But three episodes all because of a stupid wild and possibly dementia(she had the love of her life in episode one killed) suffering main female lead is kinda enough. Especially since I know the creators intention was to create a fearsome and cool main female lead and it backfired in the most laughable way. It got me thinking that it is perhaps created for teen girls and should not be regarded as a serious tv show. If that is the case I change my rating to 6.It's just a pitty cause the series in other aspects really promised.",Money_heist

They are losing the respect that they got at the beginning

2305,norbertkopec,Truly an amazing series that can suit everyone.,10/10,28 April 2020,"Personally I agree with the people who call this show a master piece. There is something for everyone, whether it be romance, action, suspense or more. One of the best things about this show is suspense. Almost every single episode ends off with some sort of suspense which pulls you into watching the next episode and then the next and so on. I have seen numerous people who say the plot is very basic and that the show is mediocre but I completely disagree. I do not want to spoil anything but I can say this show is very elaborate and makes it almost feel real with just how good it is. Can't wait till part 5 of the show.

2312,blancavconcepcion,Gripping,9/10,4 April 2020,"The season 4 of money heist starts off with high intensity, after launching missiles to the police where they picked up from the previous season, successfully operating on Nairobi without a surgeon in sight. Then it goes slow, until episode 6 where they amp the energy and release a series of bombastic events. The most shocking of all would be the death of Nairobi. We shouldn't have gotten our hopes up from the trailer when we saw Helsinki tearfully playing a morbid tune on his harmonica. But nonetheless as she survives the surgery all hopes were up, until Ganda shoots her in the head after beating up her fresh surgical wounds and shooting her in the hand. Overall it's a great watch but they could've given her death a little more dignity.",Money_heist

2314,vadymvans,Money Waste,1/10,5 April 2020,"All I can say - what a waste of money by Netflix. The only reason why I watched all four seasons is because there is literally nothing else to watch on Netflix. And the only thing I liked about this show is the visuals. Which makes me sad to see all these money wastedon a ridiculously dumb show.This show is so dumb that it makes it obvious that all positive reviews are fake. Because writing an online review requires at least a spark of human intelligence. And anyone with even a slightest spark of intelligence would be able to see how insanely dumb this show is.First, all main characters are extremely unlikable. I was literally screaming for them to die any time they had a chance. And on two rare occasions when I started to feel some partial sympathy with a character, he (not she!) inevitably dies as if any signs of intelligence were not allowed on this show.The plot is completely unrealistic, not in terms of the big idea, which is quite intriguing actually, but in details of execution. I like shows that are believable, and this one would definitely not win any points on intelligence, but I think I made it clear already.And finally, I found it very disturbing how criminals who's actions were nothing but selfish through all four seasons were portrayed as some sort of revolutionary heroes. They are not even robbing private banks, they are robbing public institutions established to ensure stability of national currency in the interests of general public. How debasing national currency by printing billions of cash banknotes or stealing the entire national gold reserve is in the best interests of the nation? It is just mind boggling, I cannot remember any show with a more ridiculous message than this.",Money_heist

2318,akshaysantms,Up for binge watching? You have reached the right place,10/10,6 April 2020,"It was recommended to me by so many of my friends. So I started watching Money Heist! I have always loved suspense thrillers but for me Money has turned out to be the best of all! Thanks to Netflix for blessing with such a world class content.It's a beautifully written story that will keep you hooked for 4 seasons. You are lucky if you haven't watched this because they have just released part 4 and it was almost an year's wait for it but trust me every minute is worth watching.I am sure at the end of s4 you will be like ""just give us the season 5 already"". It's. a perfect blend of ingenious planning, careful detailing, thinking about very minute points(that has impressed me a lot) and ofcourse the depth these characters portray.The professor is the best chatacter of all and I am sure there are many reasons to it but mainly his calm and composed behaviour.Berlin is highly missed inside the Bank of the spain! He would have lead yet another perfect yet slightly messy heist.Nairobi will be terribly missed. I don't know why it happened but it turns out that the Berlin's death resulted into a Chaotic leadership inside the heist and that's why they have just left us to the past memories of the Berlin.If you watch Money heist in English, I am sure you will fall in love with Berlin's voice!
Contained, beautiful, insightful, a little bit on the masculine side yet elegant.Spoiler: It starts to get a little messy in S3 but s4 turns depicts almost complete mess in their plan but that's how they connect with real life so well!
It's a like chess game , you might play your moves but opponent has got his own, and it might leave your burned for a while or may be even make you go downhill. I actually liked where things started falling apart naturally because it would be a bad set up if professor knows everything beforehand and the show would be too predictive. Although, It's the Professor, who has made us believe in that.S4 ends on a perfect cliffhanger and I cannot wait to unfold what's there inside in Season 5.Till then, Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao!",Money_heist
2319,hannepoorthuis,AMAZING! Keeps you on your toes!,9/10,6 April 2020,"I don't know why everyine is disliking season 4 so much, I have rarely seen a season of a show be SO entertaining and suspenseful! I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Please watch it, it is seriously spectacular.

2320,techsandtricks,Over-stretched with unnecessary parts.,6/10,24 April 2020,"Season 4 would have been a very nice season. Gandia and Lisbon should have been settled with from episodes 1-4, while the other episodes should be used for escape. Season 5 should be focused on escape alone, because right now it's the only things fans want to see.

Dialogue??? Hmm... I get the philosophy, but there are a few too many moments which are just plain stupid and ridiculous where you have to suspend rational and logical thinking. Happy to do that when I'm watching science fiction. I was loving it until I kept coming across those stupid moments. If you are happy to ignore those moments, you will love it.

1. Watch only till season 2
2. Season 3 was forced, you wouldn't rob a bank if you have 300 million euros for gods sake.
3. Season 4 was an Indian love story till episode 6
4. They are showing as to get support of fan for the bad guys, like they have forgotten that the one who is doing wrong is the heist gang not the police.Never ever try to watch 3,4 seasons.
Thank you

2344,pankajdalvi-53857,Dont know what the viewer's are crazy about.,1/10,14 April 2020,"Hard to see such a top rated series being so mediocre in its content.
There seems to be no logic in the sequence of events. The chief inspector does a nice 9-6 Job, not bothered about the hostages. Goes home nicely when she feels tired , dates her so called boyfriend.
I really like the part played by hostages. They enjoy themselves being in captivity. No one bothered to break free. Thought they make some attempts , but ultimately enjoy themselves being called hostages.
Also the robbers have their nice Team meeting every now and then , without being bothered about the hostages that they may run or hurt any of them. Liked the trust factor that was built betweent the two parties.
And lastly they buillt a nice tunnel between the Royal Mint and the professors house. The distance seemed to be less than 5 meters.
EXCELLENT JOB REVIEWING AUDIENCE!!!

I have never seen a serie which is that over hyped before. And the logic will question the intelligence of many as well as the storyline. I still dont get how this is making a buzz. Music is inadequate, acting very average and the plot seems like a bunch of teenagers who came up with it. Too much credits for that genre. I give 4 stars for the shots as they well quite well done. But other than that, stick to Ozark, trust me on that one.

I enjoyed getting to know all the characters throughout each scene, everyone has something that can connect with someone and that is what brought me closer to the show. A mixture of action, romance with a good laugh here and there, and not to mention the moments that made us cry. It really takes some serious thinking and planning to mix it all into a series that can makes us have empathy for those who break the rules and hate for those who protect us. I will not lie, at the end of episode 4... WTF??? You can't just leave a series unfinished, there are many questions open, you brought us the entire plot, we lived and breathed every episode, come on...there must be a conclusion to the end, and not just open the way you did. Tell us there is more to come.

But irritatingly low grade stuff, bad direction and barring few average acting",5/10,18 April 2020,"The basic idea of holding mint with hostage was fine and some excitement generated at times and some style. But that's it !!! A low grade stuff besides thatBad direction and complete lack of attention to details. Just some examples:1. Flaw in philosophy: The group is shown as quite innocent who only steals with the justification that big banks steal too. With professor trying to kill inspector's mother, the inspector coming out of coma and group shooting recklessly on police who is doing their job, and then keeping simple people hostage, where is that innocence??2. Technical Flaws:
Biggest one: While the professor is so super intelligent, police seems to be utter stupid that knowing such a big some of money is being stolen, police doesn't have any helicopter on stand-by, nor they lock down the city knowing group is exiting,main inspector taking her boyfriend to crime scene and within the barricaded areamain inspector dating around in an intense operation of 5 daysthe group seems to have everything inside the factory: plush sofas, coffins, candles to decorate the deadhow the hell did they leave the city and the country is never shown with police knowing they are on the run (I guess somehow one has to assume with the great brilliance of the professor, they had a way and the police is anyway stupid)In open firing inside the mint which is happening in an aisle of say 3 meter width, while commandos have shield (and hoping they are experts in encounter) and the group doesn't, not even a single heist member is injured !!!!! Are you kidding me?3. Ridiculous acting and presentation of main characters:
The main inspector in charge of such a big operation shown to be highly unprofessional, weak in character and stupid to take on the criminal alone every timeMost of the gang which is supposedly from not so well off background, has great personality, attitude, drink and eat like they have been taught etiquette, even snobbishness at timesAnd now the funny part: The main inspector being a clear suspect in being accomplice, somehow lives on the life peacefully with no investigation or charges brought on and then leaves the country to Philippines !!!!",Money_heist

There is no underlying message so do not attempt to look for one. The characters have zero depth, they are all one-dimensional and just full of themselves.There is no sense of realism between all of the underlying drama, and it seems as if they are trying too hard to portray intelligence and depth when actually the entire story-line is woven with denseness. I hope that they all get caught and imprisoned for life by the end of the series, but I guess I'll never know. If you find yourself relating to any of the main characters then, well then good luck, Charlie. :)

2360,srwatkin,The Most Over-hyped Series of Streaming Content to Date,2/10,21 April 2020,"(I couldn't get through season 2) Unpopular Opinion: Money Heist/La Casa de Papel is the most overrated waste-of-time series on Netflix (and perhaps streaming syndicates to date). Just a few reasons: over the top melodrama with psychotic 'love' stories that drown the plot; main characters that are cliche and all but impossible to sympathize with, unoriginal soundtracking borrowed from American Beauty and only 1/3 of the cast is comprised of decent acting. Most of all it is WAY too long in telling the story that needs to be told. Apparently it is being positively compared to Breaking Bad. Wow. Money Heist doesn't even come close to seeing the dirt on the bottom of Breaking Bad's feet it's buried so far beneath it. One thing I will say is the public interest it has generated in foreign production is a plus. We need more exposure to foreign film. But sorry not sorry, you can't remotely compare it to works of art like Breaking Bad. Someone please tell me how Money Heist/La Casa de Papel has a claimed a 4.8 on google, an 8.5 on IMDB and a 91% on RT. Then again, the live action version of Aladdin also got rave reviews from the general audience. Maybe as a society we are just becoming that simple/easy to please.Series that are actually worth a watch: Barry, Chernobyl, BoJack Horseman, Succession, Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, Schitt's Creek, Fleabag, Dirty Money, Killing Eve, The OA, Russian Doll, When They See Us, It's Bruno!, Bodyguard, The Americans, Westworld.",Money_heist

Then, the characters make stupid decisions to create tension that just gets exhausting. Every episode there's a scene where the characters point guns at each other for no reason. At a certain point I had to ask myself, is this a show about a bank robbery or is it a confused romance show instead? It honestly became hard to tell. But, if you want brainless, in your face television, this is a perfect series to indulge.

It's an overrated debacle and storyline defies logic. First few episodes are watchable but later you begin to think why police is made to appear so dumb, particularly officers of rank Inspector, deputy inspector and intelligence officers. Main character, The Professor, is a human but man, he definitely is portrayed as a someone with super hero powers overshadowing every other character in the whole series. Police is shown as bunch of jokers who can't even get the basics right.Save yourself from this monstrosity and instead watch something else.

I wish I could like it more, but I can't. I wanted a heist show, and I got a soap opera. They could cut like six episodes, and it would be so much better. I will not be watching the rest of the series. I could have slept through the last three episodes and I would have the same information I had after the third episode. It's slow-moving, and it loses its punch because of it.
I had high hopes, but it does not live up to the hype- at all.

2380,adrijabose,Passion and Action Wins the Race,9/10,4 May 2020,"While the show started as a Spanish staple, it made it to the International screens in no time and gathered a fanbase as loyal and dedicated as that of the big names such as Breaking Bad and GOT. Though I'll surely refrain from comparing it with the likes of the afore mentioned masterpieces, it'll be unjust to praise this one for its intelligently knit web of events and outcome. With heist movies and tv series making rounds in our To Watch List, the audience too have developed a knack of their own to determine what happens next. Money Heist strips us clean of that because it crushes our every anticipated move; atleast the first two seasons does. But as we spend more time with our beloved burglars, we learn to see through their characters- strengths and weaknesses, and once the very facet of unpredictability that made the show such a hit begins, turns it into what it shouldn't have been- slow and predictable. While the fourth season surely succeeds in picking up the pace, we are left wanting for more of that adrenaline rush and Professor's meticulous understanding of the art of a heist. But at the end of the day, Money Heist's biggest achievement will be to have millions of viewers sympathizing and rooting for the ones who are supposed to be the bad guys and hoping for a heist to become successful. Therefore, the series might not have achieved perfection, but surely it isn't one to be ignored.",Money_heist

It was going viral, on my Netflix home screen, on twitter, everywhere. So, I decided to give it a try. I feel disappointed I wasted my time on this show. I'm not a fan of fantasy shows like Spiderman, Superman, Batman etc. Honey Heist is a mirror image of super hero movies, difference being the crew here is a bunch of bad guys. I'm not a fan of fantasy shows because of the imbalance, one side is extremely strong, smart, has all the powers available right on time and other side is simply dumb. In this show too, it's the same, the cops are dumb and incompetent. The cops in this show have all the equipment, fancy gears, intelligence power, yet they screw up worse than a third world country cops, not once but multiple times, come on, are the Spanish cops really that bad? Could the makers not make is somewhat believable? The Royal Mint of Spain is under siege and the top cop is going on a dinner date? Having an affair with the main accused? Oh my, that is some level of soap opera right there. And to top it off they dragged what could have been a mini-series to 4 seasons.

2390,sirrobinmp-31121,"Soap Opera Heist weekdays after ""The View""! There I fixed it for you!",2/10,16 May 2020,"The real heist is by the writers who keep stalling for more time with more nonsense episodes while Netflix prints money.First season had promise. But shortly into the season characters start making flatout preternatural connections especially inspector Raquel. Which she corrects by missing the most obvious ones. 6 episodes in... coming out of a hazy binge stupor because your wife keeps pressing next... you realize... wait... they expect us to believe all this happens in 3 days. People recover from gunshot wounds as if they were scratches. Of course, everyone forgives and forgets. Love stories happen when someones sneezes. Investigations are mobilized across all of Spain with such immediacy and the realtime forensics of our dreams. Then the typical ""we have the all important lab results - i knew he was the guy - but your voicemail is now full - and I'm the jaded drunk lover about to have an accident/coma routine - let me call your selectively Alzheimers mother."" If only his twin would show up.... Professor Palpatine's plan then everything would be proceeding as he's forseen. If we still had TV guide this show would be on at 11 am after ""the View."" I got fooled because they didn't shoot it in live camera format with dramatic face to face pauses, watery eyes, and breakaways to commercial (remember those). Music is pretty good. I can go on... but then I would be an accomplice perpetuating the real crime of taking your time with this show (like the writers!)Watch no more than two episodes to get the gist/hype then make your escape!",Money_heist

2393,faridb,So disappointed... they lost the plot,1/10,4 September 2021,"When you expect something good and then you get way below expectations- it is disappointed. Season 5 part I totally lost the plot, filling the gaps with too many flashbacks, adding never ending gun shootouts with hardly anyone get hit or god forbid die. And if. That is. If that is enough - add The Suicide Squad with Rambo to spice up the story. This season is so bad that becoming comical to watch it. I don't get it why people giving the high scores, the show lost the soul that had in first (very good) couple seasons. I am disappointed....

However this show is incredible, it is clever, well thought out, incredibly well acted and produced that i cannot understand where reviews of 1 stars are coming from?!?If i had listened to these reviews, i would never have enjoyed the absolutely brilliant series that this is.DO NOT listen to 1-3 star reviews, they are totally unrealistic, over opinionated by people who i can only assume watched it dubbed whilst tapping away on their phones. I was totally engrossed, and loved every minute of every episode. my 9/10 would be 9.5/10 really, a realistic and not inflated review of this fantastic charachterful TV Show.Luncacy at some of the ratings.....the show is brilliant..........

2399,rahulrahman-13259,Season 1 and 2 are the best and then it just goes so wrong,5/10,16 June 2020,"The show starts as a really well written, well thought out heist. The heist may not be totally believable but the storyline was good. Season three and four are terrible, season four in particular is absolute utter garbage. You would think with Netflix money they would be able to do the show better justice but the storyline is moronic, nothing they do makes any sense. The constant deviation from common sense annoyed me more than anything. By the end of season four I was angry that some idiots let this show get produced. They should have ended the show after two seasons.

Then, thought will watch again as I found the rating is very high. But, unfortunately, there are too many incidents even for an average viewer that do not apply even to the logic of the setting of the show itself. You get into some characters' logic, and then another moment, you find those characters cancelling themselves with very foolish engagements. I am not saying the events have to be possible, but reasonable and safe in the logic the show offers in its own fictional way. As you watch, there are too many questions you as yourself as to 'why', which has no plausible answer.

2412,mathajudeen,Dumber and Dumber!,4/10,26 July 2020,"A plot can be unrealistic, impossible, illogical, or not at all satisfying your common sense. Yet, we may love watching a movie or a show for the sake of the environment it offers because we as viewers mould ourselves to fit into it, into the structure it expects us to. That is the reason we enjoy most action movies, crime thrillers, horror movies etc. However, Money Heist is a contradiction. It has a story line that could have been great, if it appealed to the same mould it wanted the audience to get into. The characters are chosen by the professor based on their great skills, but mostly they turn out to be picked randomly from the streets, considering their common sense. The plan for the heist has been going for years, and another five months of planning the action as a team, with a tunnel already miraculously built under the mint, we dont know how, and each and every incidental and psychological progress meticulously calculated. However, the series does not seem to stick to the logic even it has structured the audience to get into. Once, you are the cleverest person on earth, next, the dumbest. You are negotiating with the robbers in one scene, and the next, you are chatting with strangers in a cafe discussing the heist. As a pregnant hostage, you have your lover with you, and then you also have sex with one of the robbers! You are watching each and every movement at the crime scene, and have to be in touch with them, but at the same time have to do other chores every now and then for hours, leaving your place of work! So, so many irritating scenes that make you ask so many whys . The cleverest lot turn out to be the dumbest lot on many occasions . The character traits of the lot have never been considered by the professor, the cleverest of all, while recruiting them. I started watching it because of the rating, but was folled by it, so went on fast forwarding because skipping did not mean missing anything important, except some nonsense. And I gave after season 2. 1",Money_heist

2415,zaurduygu,Worst heist thing ever,3/10,15 August 2020,"I've watched countless robbery movies and TV shows and this is the worst.One of the first reasons is the absurdly forced continuation of the show. This series was supposed to give the final in season 2. In this type of single space series, the series gives a final after the subject is over. The second reason is character fiction. Yes, even though characters like berlin, profesor were well described and I understood their place in the series, the role of two stupid characters like Tokyo and Rio in this series was really unnecessary, especially Tokyo. The third reason is I'm tired of the stupid message that is constantly trying to be given in every heist movie / series. I don't watch V for Vandetta, I watch the robbery series. If we do not count them, the series is nice and fluent, if we do not count these cons, it deserves 7 8 points.

2432,thorvilnes,Starts well but goes downhill,3/10,7 September 2020,"I loved the first season, but it should have ended there. I finally stopped watching halfway in season two as the plot seems to just drag on forever. It seems they have to invent an endless stream of totally incompetent action from the police (and incredible luck for the criminals) to make sure this never ends. Unfortunately a good example of a series that would have been great with 10 episodes but them gets watered out far too much.

We we able to get over the attempt to dub English over the original Spanish but hard not to be frustrated by the level of stupidity from the majority of characters. Still sure who was more stupid, the police or the robbers. Robbers take hostages but often leave them unguarded, fight over ridiculous issues and screw up most parts of their meticulous plan. The police hostage negotiator is too distracted by her personal life to actually spend 24/7 trying to rescue hostages. She leaves whenever she feels like it to go home or believe it or not, go out on dates! Maybe I like my shows to make some sense and the characters to have half a brain but the reviewers here must be more forgiving. Do not waste your time, there is way too much content available to dedicate time to this mess.

2444,qwer-74499,Three reasons to watch Money Heist,8/10,26 October 2020,"Money Heist is a Spanish heist crime drama television series. The series was initially intended as a limited series to be told in two parts. Then, Netflix acquired its global streaming rights and divide it into several episodes. It currently has four parts on the Netflix platform. The plot talked about the heist events which were held by some guys, who took a female, Tokyo, as a leader and learned the heist skills by a professor. In sum, the series is attracting, touch and thought-provoking to me.
The reason why it is attracting is that in a normal condition, the criminal movies tell people the crimes and robber are always wrong, we must learn the sense of justice. However, at this one, the plots of it make people support them to success to heist at the same time.
Some of touching parts makes me so impressed. Although the robbers are from different background at the beginning, the only thing they had in common is that they were all convicts before. They all did not know each other at first, nevertheless, owing to the cooperation during the robbing, they start to build up the family-like relationships; even one of the actor, who is my favorite in this film, Berlin, sacrifices his life to save everyone escaping the bank. The scarification of the actor I love the most is literally toughing me a lot.
Despite there are some sad parts in this series the series is always thought-provoking to viewers. After watching the four series, I am always pondering the implication the director who wants to express; for instance, the theme song of it is a Italian song, ''Bella chia'', describe the mood of the warriors in the war at the battle field.",Money_heist

I really like this series because it feel chill, I binge watched the last season.
To my mind it's the best series on Netflix.

I had such high hopes for this show, it started off so SO good, but then after 6th or 7th episode of the very first season it just went downhill. Like many have already said, it turned into a very long soap opera that has very little to do with the heist. So much stuff just doesn't make sense anymore. It would have been so much better if they just created one season.

The theme music were so enjoyable and the cast singing them often were fun to see. The best written character was definitely the professor, such a nicely fitted actor for the character who did a great job. The stories behind the characters were good as well. This show is definitely a top 5 crime show and will go down in the history books. I am also happy they mentioned Portugal in some scenes as references to flashbacks or big stuff (you know what I meanüòè) cuz it's my country so it's good to see. Thank you to the studio for creating such a masterpiece, it's 200% worth a watch so do it right now if you haven't already.

The storyline is incredible. There are a lot of twists and turns, which keep the series exciting. I think each character in the story is so cool and kinda unique as well. The casts had worked hard at the rate that I can feel it from their excellent acting skill. I fell in love with all characters, no matter how evil they are. They all have compelling backgrounds. I know that sometimes their actions and thoughts are annoying. But please, don't forget that they are humans. They can't be perfect. They can make the most stupid mistakes. That's why I don't understand why people keep blaming Tokyo (the lead female character) and giving the low rating of this series. I feel like the director created all the characters in the most reasonable and relatable way. I just love all of them.This Spanish tv-series is phenomenal. The red jumpsuit and Dali mask are iconic. It became the signs of rebellion against the system. I really really love it! Everything in this story, for me, is such a masterpiece. The series keeps me watching it addictively because it is so suspenseful and unpredictable. One little action of a character can bring great disaster to the whole episode, or it can be the best decision ever.I've been searching for a series that can excite me all the way to the end and I found this. I binge-watched the whole seasons in just 1 week and watch it again in the week after. You better binge-watch it before Netflix take it off!",Money_heist
2497,ps-26277,really hate Tokyo,9/10,9 March 2021,"In the entire season I could feel the writer or the screen writer has managed to create the suspense at the end of every episode but during the entire episode the thing which I really hate was the character called Tokyo because she was always showing herself to be too busy but in actual she was just too hothead who wasn't knowing anything and also in the starting itself the plan got ruined thanks to Tokyo but on the other hand the other girl In the team was almost good she was both human had emotions and also was very intelligent in comparison to the character of Tokyo. I really hate the character Tokyo she is just the dumbest character in the entire series and she is even much more dumb then the fat buddies. she just always take the support of her boyfriend and other people to do something which is not correct and may ruin the entire plan on the other hand we have Berlin which shows much more intelligence and he is of same intelligence as the professor

So after reading a lot of reviews on here I thought I might have to make my first ever review and fight for justice.
First of all I have to say it took me about 4 episode to get into the movie and then I was hooked every character has their own individual story especially Berlin my favourite these characters alone make the series worth watching and the plan the action I give it about 5 Stars but the characters you can relate and connect to and that's why I have to say this is one of the best I've ever seen.
I only fight for those and things I love so this video is my part to defend this series anyone who hasn't seen it must watch it

2508,leblancmd,Please let me save you!,1/10,4 April 2021,"Created an account just to post this review... and hopefully save some poor souls some pain. First like many reviewers have noted, I found this show based on its impressively high IMDB rating (and after watching nearly all Netflix's original content) and made the rookie mistake of not reading the underlying comments.First off, this show is (as many have noted) terrible, not trashy bad, or campy bad, or so bad its funny bad, just bad. I am angry with myself for watching the entire first season, hoping for some improvement - none comes. According to some people who for some reason have watched all four seasons, it really drops off after season two. I sincerely have no idea how it could possibly get worse than the first season.I have never seen such a promising premise fall so flat on execution. The writing is stupefying, full of melodramatic dialogue, and impossible plot holes. Also, as many people have noted this is not a heist show, it's a very badly done soap opera with a heist setting. To those who wondered if the awful dialogue is the result of poor dubbing choices, I watched it with subtitles and trust me it's not.This show is honestly, and I am not being hyperbolic here, about the level of writing as those shows that used to be on Cinemax after midnight - with a less believable plot.To the underpaid 20-something PR flacks leaving these fake reviews, please examine your life choices and do something less sleazy, like stripping.To Netflix, I understand you are in business to make money and having ""buzz"" and ""hype"" around content sells. But maybe save some money on your fake review troll farms and spend it on greenlighting actually good content. You have some, so I know it is possible.The fact that as of the time of this writing the show has the same IMDB rating as ""Heat"", should tell everyone with a brain what is really going on here. If there is a real person here who watched both and thinks they can justify this, please let me know how.The only positives are relatively strong production values, and some attractive people.",Money_heist

2526,qzpjgcjpk,"It's a well-written, well-acted story fatally flawed by monumental police stupidity",3/10,8 September 2021,"And that's why it's ultimately not very good. I'm not an expert in police procedures, especially Spanish police procedures. However, I watch the news from Madrid every day and read a couple of Spanish newspapers daily. There are often articles that feature the Spanish National Police, and, in real life at least, they don't appear to be stupid - far from it. If the 'heroine' of the story, a police inspector with the usual personal life complications, had merely followed routine procedures, she would have saved a lot of trouble, not to mention probably saving some lives. That's what blew away my interest in this otherwise pretty good thriller. It's full of the usual caper cliches that require perhaps more than the usual suspension of disbelief, but the fine acting and good writing might have saved the series if only the police hadn't acted like idiots pretty much every step of the way. I can't imagine how the writer fell into such a fatal trap. I'm not a good writer at all, and, like I said, certainly no expert in police procedure, but even I would have known better than to act so carelessly around 'the worst criminals in Spain'. A big disappointment, because the series had such potential.",Money_heist

I have found he series to be absolutely thrilling and entertaining. With a cleverly built script that gives you the adequate dose of new pieces of the plan every chapter and while keeps it being coherent.
Not a 10 to me because I found the love affairs and 'political' parallel threads too predictable.

If you thought the professor would hire intelligent criminals, only to be betrayed with ease, YOU should be the one to which your bad review is directed and laughed at.For the people that are even a little bit educated in the dynamics between politics, media, law, philosophy and psychology this is just pure art.Not to mention the cinematography, the music, the breath-taking drama, plot (twists) and build of suspense that makes one wonder whether the series were actually produced in this era, of which the film industry has become a play-dough spaghetti maker, and not somewhere in the golden age.Dear, dear writers, directors and every one else PLEASE don't astray in season 5, you're about to make history.",Money_heist

2551,forubonly,"Amazing S1 & S2, sharp drop-off after",7/10,8 June 2021,"The first 2 seasons were amazing - smart, fast-paced, interesting. Then come S3 & S4 with ridiculous plot lines and twists, characters who belong in a soap opera, stupid mistakes made all the time, not suitable for experienced criminals. The whole reason the second heist is needed is absurd, but I chose to overlook that in S3E1,thinking the rest of the episodes will be similar to the previous seasons. I guess it was picked up by Netflix and ruined. I am not even remotely interested in the upcoming season and how this heist ends. But giving it 7 stars because of the strong first seasons.

2567,meechu-02776,Great,9/10,24 July 2021,"The biggest Heist in the history. This is probably Netflix's best and the most successful original show. In a bold story made up, full of original ideas, excellent acting, a lot of tense moments cleverly woven with funny moments- this is the jewel in the Netflix crown. The thing that keeps this show interesting is the fact that 3 different taking place at same time and three different places - The Inspector, The professor and the Heist. GREAT!!With its unpredictable and overwhelming plot, this series so addictive that one will definitely complete it in binge watch. I have been watching it since 2 days without a break. Haha! And eating like crazy. The series revolves around a very strong, mysterious, genius yet very kind man name Sergio Martinez(The Professor) who spends half of his life planning the biggest robbery in the history with a very dangerous but capable crew. Really love the strong bond between the crew. Tokyo and Nairobi my favourite ones and ohhh How can I forget The inspector? She is super dooper great at doing justice to her character. Even in my dreams last night I was into this Heist with my friend Haha!The series just gets better and better from part one to part 2, then part 3 and part 4 is even better. I can't just wait for part 5 to come. Masterpiece indeed!Totally worth the time, attention and goosebumps throughout the series! Must watch.Are you getting bored?

2677,asherz-48440,It was just another disappointed show for me,1/10,8 September 2021,"Well how do i begin? At first seeing how the storyline goes on how they planning to rob the money in the heist ,the progress was kinda thrilling ,how they evade ,the cops how the tactics was running .I really get hype of it at first ,eventhose the spotlight is on the criminal side ,the cops still have their show to run especially Raquel who attempt to accomplish her duty on catching those thieves inside the heist ....not to mention that she was a criminologist and a physiologist.Things went smooth on how those criminal plot it and executed it for the money ...but when it comes to Season 3 ....i kinda skipped through as would eager to know how the story path roughly go ....eventually i saw Raquel was suddenly with the Professor side and the reason is Love ,huh?omg .....she gave up her high rank position to be with a criminal...This is.....for me is totally unacceptable ,misleading and joke ....Logically ,Raquel character has been played was a justice ,and will do all her best to fufill her duty ...with her criminologist and physiologist skill ,i dont think a person with that skill will get easily convinced by the professor and go with him ....it was totally rubbish......
Shes kinda weak when how she being defeated by those strategies and plan that the professor has set up but uh from a cop and become a criminal is a question and doubt for me about this show ...Moreover ,after their first success on the first money heist ,the professor eventually launch another money heist again to other bank in which the storyline and the idea is kinda similar with the season 1 .....so its like repeating which makes the show not so interest to watch the same idea anymore ..Lastly , I dont think is worth to watch as the logic of the story plot is unacceptable ..i shouldnt be so serious on this haha It was just a show ....thanks for wasting my time to watch this shows and writing comment ....totally not recommended.",Money_heist
2678,estokeye,"Funny how US films don't get slagged off for being ""unrealistic"" as much as non-English stuff",10/10,8 September 2021,"La Casa de Papel is absolutely riveting. Anyone that can get passed the fact that it doesn't come from the UK or US and that, being Spanish, will have dosis of fantastic Latin passion, will be binge-watching.It's really original, superbly done and filled with cliff-hangers that'll make it really hard to stop watching. There are a lot of unexpected twists and turns and, even though there are some characters that you just want to punch, I suppose that is... well, part of life...I was really surprised that they did a 2nd series (3 to 6 series in Netflix terms), a 2nd robbery, because the first one ended in such an ""un-continuable"" way, so I was really curious to see how on Earth they were going to pull it off. But they did! And bloody brilliantly! I found the second Heist even more riveting. It is fascinating to see how the plot unfolds as well as how the intricate security system in El Banco de Espa√±a works.Like I said in the title, I read quite a few reviews criticising the lack of credibility or realism in some scenes/areas. It's an action show, for goodness' sake! Very originally and cleverly mixed with intricate relationships, love and drama, if you ask me.I've found this kind of criticism on other Spanish films, etc... before and, considering some of the outrageous stuff that is constantly coming out of countries like the US or UK, and no one seems to bat an eyelid, it all seems a bit suspicious to me ..
And if in doubt, check out the last time anyone complained about the totally and utterly, out-of-the-question stunts in any of the Bond movies (to mention one of many, many, many more...)",Money_heist

2680,nopolissportsandmedia-com,Back At,9/10,16 September 2021,"Netflix strikes again with the first part of season five of Money Heist (La Casa de Papel), the Spanish thriller where robbers, who have adopted the name of cities as their various nicknames, make a second attempt at stealing currency from the Spanish government. Even as they are committing various crimes, how the story is written invokes passion for the robbers and has led to a global phenomenon not only in the show but in reality, as it has found tremendous streaming success. Season five continues this by having viewers run through a gauntlet of emotions, it will have you excited, exhausted, upset, afraid, and cautiously optimistic.

But after Netflix bought, it tried to open for wider range of audiences. And all European traits are gone. S4-S5 are more predictable, not much energy left. Not much enthusiasm left.

Terrible acting, unrealistic casting, poor script, drags on with pointless subplots that get more ridiculous the more episodes you see. Terrible advert for the Spanish authorities, police and special forces. It's like the A Team crossed with the Oceans movies if the only similarity to the Oceans films is there is a heist!

The show should have ended with season 2! Period! I'm in the middle of season 2 and I can't digest this stupidity anymore. With every episode it gets more stupid, childish and I can not even track anymore how many love stories are going on. In the middle of 2.4 billion robbery?! Jesus!!!!! Hey Netflix, this is a soap opera/science fiction and not a crime drama.Would be probably a really good show if it would end in 2 seasons but Netflix is too greedy.

I cannot compare any of its characters to sort out the best among them. Each character (as robbers) had been important throughout the storyline.In terms of cleverness and mindfulness, I would pick The Professor! He was so calm and sharp that none could have blown his cover. Despite there having been several loose ends in their plans that happened, which were completely unexpected. Still, they managed to make things up eventually.In terms of father-son love and trust, I would pick Moscow and Denver! They acted as if they were father and son. However, I'm not going to tell how exactly. You should watch it yourself!

He first attacked the National Currency Factory, then the Bank of Spain by digging underground passages and then taking hostages who were already present in the banks to keep up the rhythms inside the factories.I think the plot is very well done, there is suspense throughout the series with the different main characters. The dialogues are well done and understandable and the English voices in the series are well done. I hope to see the last season of ""La Casa de Papel"" as soon as possible !!

Money Heist is not just a drama it is the story which wins the hearts!!!!!!!!!!! Most of the characters reveal their role in such a manner that I must say it was not a drama but a reality. Yes I must say the professor is a reality & I wish that we may see its sequel ""The Professor"" .It's worth mentioning that professor (√Ålvaro Morte) & Lisbon (Itziar Itu√±o) must be the part of any sequels of money heist because without them this story always remains incomplete. What a chemistry they both have!!!!!!!!! Nothing is missed in this drama i.e. Love, hate, affiliations , relations, humanity, wisdom , tacts , engineering etc.... Hats off to Alex Pena the creator of the story!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

From the actors to the creators this show had me hooked from the first show to the last. The only reason I'm sad is because it's over. I felt every emotion and felt my self squirming in bed waiting to see what was coming next. Honestly besides breaking bad I think this is the best show ever made. They had love, intrigue, major battles, serious conflict to deal with and amazing planning with adaptation to any situation they were confronted with. I was sad when it was over because I don't know if there will ever be a show as good as this ever made again. To the creators, actors and all involved you truly made a masterpiece and I can never think you enough for what you created for all the masses around the world. You did it, you made the greatest show ever!

It's got a lot of ""fat"" to get through at times, with some interpersonal relationship stories that don't move the plot along, and yes, as in so many series, it loses it's thread along the way of extra seasons. But still, it's well-crafted and shot, the editing and direction do a great job of creating and holding tension, and it's a great introduction to some wonderful Spanish actors.But for the love of all that is holy, invest the time to read the subtitles and watch it in Spanish. The English dub-actors are horrible! Saturday morning Scooby-Doo level voice caricatures- I think all the males were trying to conjure up Race Bannon. Que terrible!

2768,dc-fx-r,"""La Puta Madre"" de los TV shows",9/10,19 April 2018,"After wrapping up all the 22 episodes in a week or so, I must say I was surprised about how much it had delivered. It's not just a shallow heyst plot exercise like so manny others that came before. Even my previously favorite heyst movie - Ocean's 11 - does not make it to the likes of La Casa de Papel (although it has a somewhat similar vibe to it).
La Casa de Papel gets you full character development and empathy with any regular human, flawed and imperfect. I read on a previous review here that it made no sense that the perfect heyst had so many flawed execution on the characters part, but hey, that's life, that's what gets it interesting. Refreshing to see this kind of production coming from any other country than US or UK. On this case ""nuestros hermanos"" espa√±oles (I am from Portugal), present a credible spanish reality that I can relate to because there's plenty of familiarity on the characters created. So in that sense I am biased on liking it, but that's not significant for acknowledging how well it was executed! I only have to add the following, written on a similar tone as Nairobi would say:

I honestly highly recommend other not to consider negative comment. If this series isn't best then no series will be good than this. Anyway, heist planning and making and acting all was tremendous. I enjoyed every piece of episode. Director knows how to make TV series. I have been always fan of crime, thriller and twists. This series was perfect for my taste. No other series can beat it. I liked Breaking bad, Game of thrones, The sinner, Dark but La casa de papel (Money heist) is exceptionally good. I highly recommend everyone to watch this show. Worth time spending on this show. One more thing, this is a TV series not a true event. I know something which can never be done in real life, but who cares. May be it can be. However I enjoyed this show very very much. And I want to congratulate all actors and directors and all production crews. Mind blowing job guys. Keep it up! and Make this type of TV series more and more. I am still very much excited :D Many many thanks for my heart.",Money_heist

2781,imdb-560-105314,"Fun, but very unrealistic **CONTAINS SPOLERS**",3/10,21 July 2018,"Overall, I think the show was average. I definitely got hooked into watching it through to the end because I wanted to see how it all turned out. But very early on, I realized that I needed to throw all logic and common sense out the window, otherwise I was going to start throwing things at my TV :). I feel the amount of suspension of disbelief and latitude taken here are over the top.Why didn't the police just cut power to the building? That would have immediately shutdown the money component of the heist. One might argue that a mint may have internal backup generators to counter this argument. Okay, maybe I could buy that one, but with enough capacity to run all that equipment?We're given the impression that the police continue to deliver meals on a regular basis, although we only technically see this being done the first time. Why would they do this?Hostages are left alone and unsupervised through huge portions of the show. All or most of the heist crew is often seen together in the same room while the hostages are presumably in 2 or 3 separate other areas of the mint.The whole love story between the Professor and the Inspector is so over the top. I get why it's essential to the story, but it's unfathomable that during the most important crime of the century, the Inspector would have so much free and alone time, and be totally unreachable for such long periods of time.Tokyo's motorcycle ride back into the mint just drives me crazy on so many levels. Are you telling me all of those police offers are that terrible with their weapons that they can't even land one shot anywhere on her?The Inspector takes the Professor back to the original training house instead of to the police station? Makes no sense.During all of the various shootout scenes, barely anyone (in the big scheme of things) on either side is ever injured.Why did the Professor and Berlin suddenly acquire a wireless headset connection all the way at the end? Why wouldn't they have used that from the start? This was sort of explained way that it was encrypted and would take only 2 hours to decrypt.There are probably other things I've already forgotten about. I will watch the 3rd part because I can't help myself. Like watching an automobile accident :).",Money_heist
2782,phornee,"Great show, emotional and different",9/10,17 December 2018,"Definitely a must see. This is not the typical robbery film. I have read many hard critics about the fact that the characters are dumb and make silly choices. I think that this fact males the characters more human and credible. Indeed in my opinion this makes you emphatize with them, understand them, and even want them to success. Im deeply tired of perfect-inmaculate characters, that almost make my laugh. And this show will drive you yo the edge of tears. Some scenes really seem irrelevant, some songs out of the place... But later on, suddenly, all these apparently meaningless scenes join together in a really emotional way. There were preparing you for the twist.
If you want absurdly perfect, deadly heroes, this is NOT your show. You will not find James Bond, Danny Ocean or Ethan Hunt here.Bella ciao, bella ciao, bella ciao, ciao, ciao

2783,sdg009,Not bad until midway through season 2,7/10,8 September 2019,"Season 1 was really good and then it becomes so illogical and tedious.
Most irritating to watch is Tokyo's character who keeps making mistakes and nobody says a thing. Equally annoying is the storyline between Tokyo and Rio. I just keep hoping not to see them on the screen.
Other characters and actors seemed fine.
Overall it's a watchable series because of the decent direction and acting by some of the key people. Also, English audio could have been better dubbed, there is a lot more depth and character in the original Spanish audio version.

2789,venom-gr,Missed opportunity,5/10,23 September 2018,"Started with a nice idea, reminding me a lot of inside man, then it went downhill. Lots of plot holes and things that don't make sense. It was a nice change to watch a Spanish series though. It can be a lot more enjoyable if you don't think of what you are seeing I guess, but I couldn't. The plot holes, the most stupid police in the universe and some very annoying meaningless characters, like seriously what on earth did Tokyo bring on the table as a thief, no expertise on anything, just there to poke her nose into everything like a hot headed arrogant she was.Sorry but this is definitely not a 10. It could easily be, it had all the potential, many things it did right, but if you are lacking in the scenario it cannot be hidden behind some very nice character progression, performance and general atmosphere. And don't get me started about the ending, common.

I wanted to binge watch something and this show was better that the average trash that is out there. But by no means this can get anything more than 7. 
The plot holes are big enough to plant trees in them, most characters are utterly stupid, do not develop and keep messing that ""great plan"" and although it is a close competition between the professor and Tokyo, the professor wins with his insane decision to get intimate with the worst possible person. 
There are worst things to watch out there.

2793,dermotmoriarty,8.4 rating?,1/10,27 July 2020,"I suffered through 5 episodes of this absolutely awful excuse for TV. It's even more poorly written and less believable than the plot and character set of The Walking Dead.I see that it's really highly rated and that's fine. I guess if you're a complete idiot then this show will really knock your socks off. If you however want to avoid having your intelligence insulted, some of the worst narration ever written but also some laughs (at how bad it is), then I'd find something else.Anyone who likes this, seriously, don't procreate.

2796,aouni_tahech,Avoid unless you're not very critical about tv series in general,2/10,23 February 2018,"SPOILER: Immediately after watching 2-3 episodes of S01, I started getting a feeling that there's something not right about this series. I didn't want to judge on spot, so I continued watching. The more I watched, the more it turned out to be as I expected, an amateur, shallow, and weak script, performed by not so interesting characters.Berlin is good, but the others are meh.So, this series about a robbery that has been supposedly planned for so long, yet you discover how foolishly it is managed and operated. Many times you see 5-6 kidnappers out of 7 in one room, and you wonder, who's left watching the 40+ kidnapped persons.The operations room where the detective runs the rescue mission detects any telephone signal within a 30 meters area, yet the assistant manager had a voice recorded injected in his eyeglasses, and he's at the tent, but nothing triggers any warnings! It's not a static voice recorder, it's TRANSMITTING voice signal to the professor!Lots and lots of simple and stupid overlooks like that make me question the capabilities of the director/writer/producer. I'm not a police officer or IT expert, but I mean it's common sense to consider such details. It blows my mind to see such TV series and similar movie being rated 8+ on imdb. How? Just HOW?",Money_heist
2797,spilak-the-berserker,Great idea destroyed by poor plot development and implausible situations,3/10,29 November 2019,"Watched season 1 and 2, which is a finished unit. I do not plan to watch further.First, the good stuff: the basic idea is great as well as some of the twists. Also, characters were well developed and consistent. But...More often than not plot development is poor as it is too far from approximately solid ground. Some actions taken by characters are outright stupid or unnatural to the situation and would never happen to experienced robbers that were chosen and trained for half a year. Same goes for the police officers side.
Sometimes characters do actions that do not make any sense, only to fulfill the criteria that is required to drive the plot further to the desired direction (e.g. Denver's real gun exposure makes no sense).
Also Professor's ideas require series of coincides to happen. Not one or two events, but series of them.Of course, I get that some of mentioned is necessary to make things interesting, but in this series, it is used to the extent where it becomes untasty. Most of the situations just do not hold the water.
Also, 3 days into the heist there are already so many romantic relationships going on, it is disgusting.Be warned that the series are loaded with cliffhangers, so often you can't help yourself to watch another (mediocre) episode. For this reason, I don't even recommend you to start with it. Trust me, if your brain is not numb, you can't appreciate these series.Also, I have to mention that overall I've skipped 4 (shorter Netflix) episodes (carefully chosen by description) and never had a feeling that I've missed something out.",Money_heist

2799,ashiztooambitious,Bunch of impulsive & emotional fools on a heist.,7/10,5 May 2020,"Bunch of impulsive & emotional fools on a heist. One time its acceptable. But why planning heist with same members. In the first season, throughout the season I was thinking, Professor could have hired 2 thieves more for the heist who could do his jobs outside of the bank and monitoring chamber. Why he always going out every time and heist is going for toss now and then once he steps out. They form a rule but nobody cares about it. Probably that's what writer and director wanna show. That Professor is not so smart, police can catch him now then if they have a will to do so. All they need is to come out of their monitoring rooms. Within minutes we have seen police uncovering professor's hideout in single episode. But then you wont have so many chapters and successful heist. Enjoy the show. Its one time watchable. Everyone acted superbly in this series. Background scores are fantastic. Lets see when they are able to release chapter 5.

2801,osama_okasha,Do not watch this series,1/10,9 March 2018,"Overrated, the most stupid plot twist ever, how can the director miss these crazy major details. and how can these actors pass through the filters of the auditions. How come spain is empty of good actors. I couldn't stand watching each episode without hitting the wall because how was stupid I am to listen to the one who advised me to watch this.The only reason that I'm giving it two stars instead of one, is that I liked the soundtrack at the credit of each episode. Even the only good think they made it 20 seconds only.DO NOT WATCH THIS SERIES AND STOP YOURSELF BEFORE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE

The sets are so rich and full of character, filmed so beautifully. The music expertly interwoven... a blend between classical, folk and modern.... above all, the characters and acting is just stunning.Alvaro Morte would win an Emmy if he was in the US. His amazing delivery, his pauses, the way he is able to portray his thoughts and feelings through his eyes is just incredible. He even found a way to fix his glasses on his face in an interesting way. Equally awesome is Pedro Alonso and the scene between him and Alvaro singing Vela Ciao will make you wish you were their brother!
This show is just awesome.

2804,chris-chrysostalis,Highly entertaining,8/10,7 January 2019,"I have watched all season 1 and most of season 2 so far. Its nice change from the usual US serials, with a nice story reminding me of Ocean 11. The key element of the serial is the mind battle between the organizer of the heist and the police. Directing and Photography is very good. The scenario has a few flaws but that does not take away any of the its entertainment value. As for acting, its quite decent, some better than the restI would recommend it based on what I have seen so far. I am a bit sceptical of the extra season that Netflix will produce, since this is a heist, how much can you drag it till its resolved one way or the other. Enjoy!

Season 2 - now it's becoming ridiculous, not even worth watching.
It's becoming a comedy of errors & unbelievable.

2822,Krstevski_b,Slowly Fading,3/10,26 April 2020,"First season was really something... Unusual, fresh, modern, unpredictable and cool, i couldn't wait until next episode.
Unfortunately after the first season Casa de Papel has turned into a classic spanish novella. It went from ""crime/ thriller"" to ""drama/ romance"", Lots of soap opera twists, lots of crying and stupid unnecessary moves. Just classic spanish drama where it all ends with ""Casandra your aunt is your mother, and your boyfriend is your brother"" .... totally predictable and not interesting, Please give us back the old Casa de Papel.

Sometimes with succesful series I get a feeling of ""ehmm... ok. Is this the ending?? Like.. this just doesn't make sense."" I didn't expect that La Casa's would be this good!! I cried, laughed and got chills during the last episodes üòä Great ending to a great series üí™üèºAnd I want to add that it is quiet amazing how a Spanish series was watched all over the world. And that they have achieved to do this as the firsts in Spain. (This big!) WOW.

And a lot of characters were really annoying in this heist show, so I was just switching off the show, especially when the singing started :D",Money_heist
2827,shacharpolak,I don't get the high ratings,6/10,23 November 2018,"The hgh rating does not reflect on the actuall quality. This show is average and nothing more.
I agree it's fun and can be seen to kill spare time. But calling this show great just shows you lack experience with good tv shows. Go watch Breaking Bad, Dexter, GoT, The Shield, Lost. Then I want to hear you say La Casa de Papel is even close in terms of quality, acting, plot, intrest.So many plot holes, so many predictable moments. Don't fall for the hype. This is not a ""great"" show like some people hail it.

2851,surenarajabi13,A populist who sings bella ciao !,4/10,28 July 2021,"At fist you think it will surprise you with a complex idea but wait, it is a serie that just tries to make everyone happy after watching. I could say acting. Locations and soundtrack is fine, story line is not realistic. They dont diminish main characters at correct time. Criminals power and freedom has been considered over estimated.

No, it's not perfect, has minor plot flaws, yes, some characters are acting idiotic sometimes but overall it's enjoyable.

2867,aileen-hallie,Honest review of an amazing series,8/10,17 August 2020,"I could not stop watching episode after episode, because of the clever cliffhangers. It is a beautiful series full of action and drama. I like the symbolism and rawness of the series. However, some decisions of certain characters felt ""out of character"". But when you decide to accept those choices of the characters, you really can't stop watching, at least I couldn't. I love the way we get to know everyone and how the series becomes more ""personal"" in part 3 and 4. Because of the flashbacks, you really get to know the characters and I felt somewhat confused when I actually started to see the main characters as the ""good guys"". It is interesting to realize how society makes us believe that ""good and bad"" is like ""day and night"". But the series show us that everyone is just human with their own problems and motives. There is no strict line between a bad person or a good person.
To conclude, the acting is azing and the series is definitely worth watching if you like a smart, thrilling and emotional journey while sitting on the edge of your seat!

The professor becomes a household name across the world and every costume party has men and women with Dali masks and jumpsuits in them. I'd rate the show at 9/10 up until the second season. It's a pot full of gold for Netflix and then the greed steps in. The returns season after season and it's only so many plot twists one can have with the same characters and concept. Everything feels like a drag now. The Heist pulled off is the one on Netflix. The best OTT platform feeling the heat of competition and trying to keep the cash registers ringing.

2899,giuliobaia,"Disappointing, and although not deserving of a 1 star rating this SHOULDN'T HAVE an 8.5+ rating here on IMDB",1/10,15 May 2018,"Many, I included, use this platform as a way to be efficient with time and try to seek out what would seemingly be the best TV-shows and movies with little research needed. Apart from niche types of films which are either loved or hated, IMDB used to be a very reliable source, but as time passed and as it grew in popularity, we see more and more instances of unworthy titles getting flooded with 10-star ratings which (sometimes) get balanced by just as many 1-star ratings, leaving you with a funny inverted Bell curve. This isn't how things SHOULD work, but unfortunately, this is what we get.Let's start with the good first. I initially found the story interesting, since the general plot is original and ingenious. And that's about it. This could've been a great series, so let me tell you where I personally think things went wrong: 
It all starts with the writing. The writing is ATROCIOUS. As I stated above, although the GENERAL plot and story were great, as the entire thing unfolded mistakes upon mistakes started piling up, forming plot holes, hilariously impossible and nonsensical scenarios. The characters seemed all one or two-dimensional, and most never even saw the shadow of any sort of character development. As I kept watching I soon came to realize that this show was made to be mindlessly watched, catering to the masses with their daily dose of sex, violence, and tension, while delivering very little substance to reflect on. And to make all of this worse, couple it with some (very) bad acting (not sure because of the directing or the actors themselves). In the end, La Casa del Papel is entertaining for those who seek to procrastinate filling their time with nothingness, but if you're actually looking for a complex and well-written TV-Series you might want to look elsewhere. (the two best examples of this I could give are Westworld S 1&2 and/or True Detective S1, a true masterpiece).

2906,loulymado,I didn't know this show was that good!,8/10,13 August 2019,"Fascinating! I never thought that this show is that good. What made it a good experience for me was a few different reasons:
1. The pacing of the series: It is the first time that I watch a show were 5 days take place in only 19 episodes. There were some episodes were we get to live only an hour or two in the world of our characters. There is no single scene that has no use or convenience to the plot, also not a single boring one. Each conversation or incident happens for a reason that develops the characters or for us to learn things about the world of La Casa de Papel or the characters.2. The realism of the human nature: Our characters are not perfect. The writers use that lack of perfection in favor of the development of the characters. Police members not being perfect. Gang members not being devils and 100% bad.
I really liked this show. I'll give it 8/10. However, there are some aspects that kind of ruined it for me, especially at the end of season 2. For example: some characters being too smart - sometimes unrealistically - and other that should be smart are behaving very very naively that it was not convenient to me.",Money_heist
2907,rubanov,Totally unrealistic. An average heist show at best,3/10,18 April 2018,"I really like heist movies and I thought I was really going to like this show. I watched both part 1 and 2 and in the end this show proved to be a hit and a miss.
Positives
Most of the times it is entertaining if you don't take it seriously.
Some of the actors are really good.Negatives
Huge plot holes. I will not mention all of them because it would take too much time. For me they completely ruin the main story.
*** WARNING Spoilers ahead ***The biggest plot holes resolve around the so called ""intelligent"" Professor:Why does he tell Angel where he lives? Or at least, in the vicinity of where he lives. Because Angel shows up on his front door soon after that.Why does he let Angel in his hideout??? This makes no sense whatsoever. Angel can not be sure that Salva is in the building. He could be out, he could have the wrong building. It is really easy to simply not open the door. Angel does not have a search warrant. Also at the same time there was a crisis in the heist so it makes even more sense not to let him in. Still, he lets him in and this allows Angel to take his fingerprint and test the cider. This decision causes the coma of Angel and also lots of suspicion from Raquel.Why does he let Tokyo take part in the heist? She is completely unstable, cannot take orders or stick to the plan. She is a ticking time bomb and should be nowhere near a heist. Also why does she go back to the Casa after she was set free by the Serbians? A place surrounded with police, snipers and trained gunmen... By some miracle she is not shot (seriously, how can they miss her?) but she still ends up causing Moscow's death.Why is he alone in the hideout? He hired Serbians but only uses them towards the end. The only smart way to handle the heist is to stay put in the hideout and let the Serbians do the dirty work like remove fingerprints from a car they used or dig. He should have also kept Rio with him in the hideout. The guy is a dead weight in the heist but is a hacker so could be useful working behind the scenes.Why didn't he let the Serbians dig the hole further towards the vault before they even started the heist. Perhaps someone would notice the noise but i doubt it. Even so, he could have asked the Serbians to start digging again the second his team enters the Casa at the beginning of the heist. El Professor keeps saying that gaining time is key to the success of the heist. Focusing on digging seems obvious but again, this focus comes only at the end.Why did he make Berlin the leader of the heist? He definitely has leadership qualities but he also ordered a kill of a hostage when there were many other options. Also, the guy is a maniac and litterly rapes a women on the show. El Professor keeps saying that the public needs to approve of the heist but that is difficult with a guy like him. (the character Berlin was a very interesting character played by an amazing actor and a great addition to the show but it just doesn't make any sense to pick him as a leader).How did he escape to the Filippines? They know how he looks, he was even on TV. They could have easily closed the city streets. And as an extension, the borders/airports etc.At the end El Professor says that his plan was perfect except for the fact that he fell in love with Raquel. But of course this is complete horse crap because his plan was ridiculsly flawed. It was actually a miracle (and bad police work) that so many of them got out.The list goes on but you get the point. I can take a few plot holes to force the story to go from point A to B but in this show has a crazy amount. The show simply lacks realism.",Money_heist

2909,emir-aganovic,Amateur,3/10,12 April 2020,"This TV show is ridiculous. I don't know how it get this rating. Great idea,but already in third episode completely ruined. Denver,act as a psyhatric giving money to hostage,explaining why she shouldn't get an abortion. That shot in the tigh and hostage pretending to be dead. Ridiculous. Denvers daddy sleeping in middle of raid. High profile negotiatior in middle of heist go home want to arrest her ex husband because he went out with his daughter,then sitting for hours in caffe while heist is going on. After five months of planning everybody acting like spoiled children without any professionalism. Totally amateuristic show. I gave up after fourth episode because is ridiculous.

Do yourself a favor and don't even bother starting season 4!The dialogue writing has deteriorated to the level of ridiculousness, the plot seems so forced, characters act obviously stupid so the story can go the way it is intended while some have plot Armour thicker than the vault walls of the Spanish Reserve bank. Someone getting shot at by 5 or so people with M-16 machine guns from a couple of meters but getting away without so much as a scratch. Bullet proof vests now seem to change ballistics here.I was never this disappointed with a TV show.
Seems money and swift release dictated this recent season.

From the very beginning I was asking myself the sam questions over and over again, 'does this series worth watching?'. Not only the story has several loopholes and poorly constructed, but also the acting from the cast was very very disappointing.Sometimes it happens that you will find something good even in an average type of series. However, I was unable to find any good quality in this series. Yes, I have completed watching the first series. You may be wondering if I did not like the series why did I finish the first part. It took me about two months to complete the first 13 episodes. It's the complete opposite of 'binge'.As I don't know Spanish, I watched the series with English subtitle first. The subtitles are very poor. Dialogues are very lame and shallow. If you are a serious viewer of quality, please don't watch it.",Money_heist

They started with a good idea, intriguing characters and an elaborate plot.
By the end of season 2 it became apparent they could not drag this anymore.
Season 3 was just a ""remake"" of season 1 but, my God, season 4 is an awful soap opera...seems almost like a ""filler"" season...no actual plot, no actual action...you could skip straight to episode 7 if u want and still..you wouldnt miss a thing.
Hire better writers, because this cast is impeccable.

But I saw a lot of recommendations for this show. So I started to watch. First two seasons are mind blowing and only thing in my mind was, ""Why didn't I watched this series before"". So I continued to watch the third season. Though it got some similarities with the first two season, I enjoyed it. But the last season was totally waste of time. If they drag the same story like this, people will eventually get bored. So I think it's time to finish the 2nd Story line and start a new story line apart from the first two.So If you are looking forward to watch this show, I really recommend it. First two seasons are mind blowing. So first watch them. After that. no argue you are going to watch the other two seasons.

2934,maxibartosik,"Season 1 amazing, Season 2 very hard to watch",1/10,27 January 2019,"The show starts off really well, hooking the audience on the plot of the perfect robbery. There's great acting from lots of at the time fairly unknown actors (at least to me) and in general the cast seems like a great fit for their characters.For season 1 I would call this a really good series with very few things one could criticise. Towards the end it starts to drop off a little though with things feeling stretched out a bit.
With season 2 it all starts to go downhill. I won't spoil anything but it really becomes very cringeworthy to watch, it almost feels like someone wrote a parody on romance and action movies. It continues to become less and less believable to a point where I personally just gave up and let it happen waiting to see the end. Especially at the very end there's a scene with the main protagonist and it was so embarrassing to watch, it made me feel embarrassed about telling my friends how great this series is after watching the first couple of episodes.It feels a little like the writers were pushed to add a second season and add more drama and excitement through stupid and stereotypical action scenes. Unfortunately this is not suitable to just watching the first season so the series is ruined by the second half, definitely a real shame.",Money_heist

2939,prasurhythm,NOT WORTH WATCHING,1/10,26 December 2019,"This is probably the worst series I ever watched on Netflix. How is this so highly rated and popular is beyond my grasp. There is no logic, and the acting my most of the actors is terrible (esp Tokyo..couldn't even watch her scenes without skipping) And the lead inspector is the worst written character ever. Such a joke!

Many of the positive reviews talk about how unpredictable it is. Yet I find the show highly predictable at every single turn in every single episode. The infighting between the different police agencies during the hostage taking is laughable. This is been done over and over and over. These bank robbers have to be the sadest bad guys (and girls) a TV series has ever had. To each his own I suppose, but I recommend taking a pass on this one. Oh, the acting is B level.",Money_heist

Granted there were a few cringe worthy moments but that's what makes it not run smoothly. Be pretty dull if they made no mistakes. The heist team are great and I have to admit I shed a few tears too. So come on crack on with season 5 we are waiting.
Watch it and see for yourselves if you like it or not, if we had gone on the reviews we wouldn't have watched it and we couldn't stop.

2952,arnas-langaitis,an average melodrama with horrible writing disguised as a heist show,4/10,18 April 2020,"The creator of the series had the right idea and a lot is done right.Writing, however, is what absolutely ruins the show. My problem with it is that every character in the show is an absolutely obnoxious idiot who couldn't mug someone in a wheelchair let alone pull off the ""biggest heist in history"".Characters feel like they we're written by a six year old's kid definition of a 'bad man'. These people are portrayed as the top criminals in their line and fail to convince you so every chance they get. The professional thief doesn't know what fingerprints are, the hacking prodigy leaves a hostage alone with her phone to discuss relationship with his girlfriend, the impulsive fightstarter backs down from anyone who speaks to him in a tone (including hostages). Half of the events wouldn't happen if the characters were not morons.Everyone is overly melodramatic and get butthurt over minor things instead of focusing on what they need to do. As the title says, it's a melodrama not a heist. The show tries so hard convincing you there's tension but there isn't any. Not a single action has any consequence, the characters are not presented with difficult choices. The only thing that seems to be in risk are the fragile feelings of the main characters.If you're familiar with the concept of show don't tell, money heist is the opposite. All tell and no show. Hard to believe that this has such a high rating. I watched the first season and hoped it would get somewhat better in the 2nd but it somehow got way worse.Don't waste your time.",Money_heist

2955,cartermckaughan,Great First Season.....but,7/10,3 June 2018,"The first season really hooked me with a very impressive idea for the perfect heist. However season two really fell apart. It was almost as if a different production crew took over. Way too much emotion, drama, love etc. The ending is not only awful, but totally unrealistic. There is no way some of the stupid decisions made by the police would actually happen, and no explanation is given as to how one of the key characters just walked away. Worth watching, great cast, but just a train wreck of an ending.

It is a pleasant romantic fiction adventure, with a superficial revolutionary message which will make you probably have a good time if not biased. It is generally well done in most aspects, esp. If you consider that it is spanish. It's not a 10/10 and certainly not 1/10. What I mostly read here is bipolar reviewers based on their personal feelings which have to do with their expectations due to hype,or other things that have nothing to do with reviewing the show.

The whole concept of this ""impossible heist"", the mysterious plan, the interesting characters and the tension gets you invested. But as the show progresses, the plot seems to start to drag, the show switches over it's focus from the actual heist, to the all the love stories going on. And trust me, there are a lot! Everyone of the characters seem to find the love of their life, all while casually robbing the Royal Mint of Spain. Even more, the heist-men suddenly shift from following the plan they had been preparing for 5 months, to not caring about it at all. Especially some of the heist-men's behavior just becomes irrational and childish. Don't get me wrong, I am willing to overlook some details in an action show, but this series requires you to completely switch off the logic in your brain in order to watch it after some point. For me, this show feels like the writers had a good idea, and then just didn't know where to go with it, ending up with a bunch of cliches.

2969,agnks13,"Success isn't about quantity, but quality!",7/10,7 April 2020,"Money Heist - La Casa de Papel is the perfect example about knowing the limits and setting goals. The first two seasons had plot holes, mistakes etc. but it was exciting to watch undoubtedly! It was one of the most thrilling shows and this was the absolute success! However, the next seasons did everything wrong just for views and of course money, marketing and commercial.. The same thing over and over again! It's just boring now..

2976,smartyvipulchandak,A great show which got ruined because Netflix wanted to make money.,8/10,9 April 2020,"1st 2 seasons were intense and things made sense.
Easily binge watch worthy.
Rating for them - 8.53rd season was pretty average but wasn't that bad
Rating - 7.54th season
(rating - 6.5)
Way too many plot holes people are doing anything
No character development
No feelings for those characters apart from 1 or 2.
Remove gandia and nothing to watch in it.
Rio is the worst actor ever.
This series will go down hill from here.
Disclaimer - I have watched dimdb top 250 movies and TV series too

2977,igor-tatar,"Netflix, are you ok?",3/10,8 April 2020,"Characters are changing faster then the light moving thorught the universe, unable to track the logic of them and all because of LOVE. That's not a heist movie, it is a romantic comedy of stupidity. I really like the heist part (1/10 of the movie) and it is incredible, but the truth is that Netflix is trying to highlight one part and forgets about the other, too much plot holes, too much drama, too much values that are not in the right place at the right moment of time.

I pushed through season 1 and regret doing that cause I felt committed and had to see it through. What a disappointment and 17 hours of my life I'll never get back. The plot is poor, the storyline is predictable and the acting. Oh my the acting, just terrible. I actually was forwarding through episodes in the last season cause I knew by then what was filler and what was, and I use this term loosely, important. Just don't do it. You've been warned.

So expect a ragtag group of people with several faults all held together by someone who isn't really a criminal but a planner. Things never go to plan and it was really interesting to see how he tried to account for many events and expected reactions of the police. Expect to eagerly await each series as you get drawn in to the many characters of the movie. Really enjoyed and can't wait to see more....

It's just ridiculous and frustrating to watch, especially season 5 where action should kick off. Example: In the middle of a fighting scene they suddenly decide to talk about nonsensical stuff, feelings and other bs. And they do this all the time. It's like they intertwined action movie with the cheesiest soap opera in existence.If you are starting to watch this show, take my advice and stop at season 2. Up until that point it's fairly fun show and it has a decently wrapped ending. What they did later is just a waste of time.

HOWEVER, season 4 maybe the worst season of any show ever including GOT. So unrealistic. HORRIBLE just horrible.

3001,dani_raducanu,should have kept it short and simple,5/10,11 April 2020,"A series with an interesting idea for a heist that becomes dumber and dumber the longer it lasts.The characters could have been better written and many of them are inconsistent. Betrayals and plots are planned only for the plotter to have a last minute change of heart and confess everything just in time to foil any situation that may end the heist. Characters that are moments away from killing each other seem to be perfectly at peace (or in love) a few hours later, as if nothing happened.The police handling of the situation is shockingly unprofessional on all levels. Following the hostage escape the policemen on site stand passively and watch for a few minutes instead of storming the breach, giving enough time to the robbers to barricade themselves again.The officer in charge takes time off what should be the most important case of her career to grab drinks and sleep with an unknown man. Not even when there is ample evidence that she might be sabotaging the investigation is she put under arrest. In season 1 and 2 we are lead to believe that she is a tough professional, a woman in a men's world that had to prove her worth time and again, yet she is constantly displaying poor judgement, lack of professional pride and unprofessional conduct. Instead of turning the Professor in as soon as she uncovers him, she decides to interrogate him alone, with predictable results, although she had been warned that the Professor might be proficient at hand to hand combat. The story appears to be pushing her into an absurd they-lived-happily-ever-after love affair with the one person who outsmarted, violated her privacy and humiliated her at her job.Not that operational security matters for the robbers either: some don't shy away from taking lovers from among the hostages and sharing the plans with them, and the others robbers don't seem to mind that.In spite of all the shooting there are only a few casualties, and this makes the series feel like some Saturday morning cartoon, where not even the bad guys get hurt. While the robbers may be firing intentionally wide, the police appears to be suffering from Stormtrooper level marksmanship.The criminal mastermind gets lucky and escapes so many close situations that I actually began rooting for the police to catch him. He is the team leader, yet as the series advances it's obvious that he lacks leadership skills and cannot impose its will on the team. He's got a tearjerking story attached (as most of the robbers have) to divert the viewer from the fact that not only is he's a crook, but he's also greedy and full of vanity as well, given the sheer amount they're stealing.
To be honest, I expect him to be robbed by the Serbs.Overall, the series is just like a heist - the longer it lasts, the more likely things can go wrong. Looking back, the idea is fine for a movie, but unsuited for a multi-season TV series. From season 3 the story is just implausible, the plan becomes more and more unrealistic with every convolution and the characters make absurdly poor choices.Just watch something else...",Money_heist

3007,damir-popovic-88,Overrated.,4/10,18 August 2019,"The concept is nice. The plot gets well established during the first episodes with planning, character introduction and rules.My main issue is the bad writing overall. Meaning that the execution of the plot is a mess. The characters force themselves into the silliest situations. Usually this can be ignored, but it happens too often.
The expectations I had got ripped after watching ep 4. and the serie went onto more important things like, pregnancy, divorce, strong women, evil men etc. You know, Netflix enforcing their political view.

3008,cari22,Perfect,10/10,19 May 2018,"The show will keep you on the edge of your seat, and you really get attached to the characters. I know there's a lot of symbolism, and for many people it's about resistance. But to me the best parts were the love stories and the redemption of certain characters. I loved the acting of Pedro Alonso Ochoro (Berlin) and especially Alvaro Morte (El Profesor). All the acting was excellent, from the entire cast. I usually like tragic endings when I watch a thriller, because it's more realistic. But with this, you're rooting for the characters so much that you're hoping there won't be a sad ending. I've recommended this show to everyone I know.

For example we have this professor who is supposed to be brilliant but obviously makes irrational/ stupid decisions. But there are many examples of such occurrences from different characters. Secondly I don't find the plot so original. They borrowed ideas from a few movies/ series and they put them together. I gave it a 1 because I find the 8.7 irrationally high.

Hostage and captor falling in love, criminal mastermind, eccentric leader who turns out to be noble and a maverick firebrand character (Tokyo)Buut..soon enough all logic starts disappearing. Charcaters keep contradicting themselves in every episode. All the past scenes are just put in to build a haphazard storyline, as if each episode is written after the last one ended. Everyone is crazy! Nairobi getting up and walking after a lung surgery, standing straight after her arm is shot! Denver objectifying Tokyo and in the very next episode taking a hands off approach! Palermo being an utter idiot
The most infuriating character is Arturo Roman..just throw him out already! Everyone, everyone is just doing mindless things.

Some of the characters such as Berlin are professional and smart, which is good for the plot. It could have been a great series. But the show went downhill after Tokyo's relation with Rio is introduced. Their love is not reasonable at all and Tokyo kept using love as an excuse to ruin the plan of the entire team, putting everyone in danger but did not pay for her mistakes. Besides, there are just so many plot holes in the show that I don't want to spoil here. The police are totally dumb and useless that they deal with the criminals in such stupid and inefficient methods. Many of the characters in the show does not help develop the plot but just annoy the audience so much, one of them being Tokyo who is so immature and arrogant which kept bringing trouble to the whole team. The actions of the characters are simply not understandable and the show simply doesn't deserve such a positive rating. I would have given it a better rating if not for the annoying characters and plot. Such thrilling topic simply doesn't mix well with undeveloped and sudden emotions and love between the characters.",Money_heist

That said, the final episode drove me nuts. Very non-Hollywood ending, which many appreciate but to my mind it ended on a cliffhanger and so at least one more series is surely coming...please, please, and soon.

It turned out to be a soap opera with an interesting idea but extremely annoying execution. I found myself almost shouting at the tv with all the gaping holes in the plot and logic. For example: criminals turn off all phones in the building so that they don't get hacked - one criminal makes a mistake and let's hostage use the phone for 2 minutes - the police hack into it and use the camera to identify criminal. Literally the next episode a few more phones are turned on and waved around criminals faces but nobody seems to.bw afraid of hacking nor do the police detect any phones being on.

This is the best one I have ever watched. If you didn't watched this one, it's meaningless to use Netflix.

3067,kalfer-67358,My favourite series,10/10,11 December 2021,"I'm a sci-fi series viewer, but until recently my favourite was Breaking Bad. That was until ""Money Heist"" (La Casa de Papel) came along.Money Heist has everything a good series should have: action, suspense, humour... It's a complete spectacle on the screen, and at times a masterpiece.The seasons of the first heist were incredible. And those of the second robbery too, despite having parts with a lot of shooting and grenades. I think the team of scriptwriters, direction, photography, etc, has managed to create a sublime product, with epic moments, surprising plot twists, and emotionally charged sequences, where you can even cry. Bravo!

3071,helianthus-90444,Not perfect but still an interesting TV show to watch,8/10,28 November 2018,"To be honest, i've expected so much when i watched the very first scenes.I imagined to see those pro experts criminals run a genius robbery plan. But it all fell down since Tokyo's appearance.
This show absolutely have so many unlogical flaws like there're many scenes that we can't see any members watch on the hostages (??) The fool of some member (Tokyo & Rio, somestimes Denver) make us feel very disappointed and annoying.
But on the other side, i have to say i love this show. Why? Because i love Berlin's consciousness, professional and super cool attitude of Nairobi (You don't know how much i love her!), the brilliance of Professor's genius head and i feel so pity for the inspector Raquel.So with this show, i still annoy with stupidity of Tokyo & Rio (I sympathize for Tokyo cause she's iconic in commercial side) but i also thrill to see what will happen next. I do see many flaws but yet i still love this show.

3073,charudutjshetty,Throw your logic out the window before watching this show,4/10,20 April 2020,"Like everything in this generation, I discovered this TV show through hype. It was going viral, on my Netflix home screen, on twitter, everywhere. So, I decided to give it a try. I feel disappointed I wasted my time on this show. I'm not a fan of fantasy shows like Spiderman, Superman, Batman etc. Honey Heist is a mirror image of super hero movies, difference being the crew here is a bunch of bad guys. I'm not a fan of fantasy shows because of the imbalance, one side is extremely strong, smart, has all the powers available right on time and other side is simply dumb. In this show too, it's the same, the cops are dumb and incompetent. The cops in this show have all the equipment, fancy gears, intelligence power, yet they screw up worse than a third world country cops, not once but multiple times, come on, are the Spanish cops really that bad? Could the makers not make is somewhat believable? The Royal Mint of Spain is under siege and the top cop is going on a dinner date? Having an affair with the main accused? Oh my, that is some level of soap opera right there. And to top it off they dragged what could have been a mini-series to 4 seasons. Learned my lesson, don't jump on the hype wagon, do your research before wasting time on something like this again.",Money_heist

3080,toddmckeown,"Turn brain off, easy to follow action series. 7.5/10",8/10,28 August 2019,"My first review of a tv series, yet alone European series. Honestly I have to say I rather enjoyed the first two seasons and have listed all the pros and cons below:Pros: The series are well paced and they lead into each following episode nicely. Great acting particularly from the characters Berlin and the Professor. Great score and limited CGI is rather effective. Locations on all sets (filmed in Spain) are wonderful.Cons: Too many chiefs and not enough Indians, basically there are so many changes and shifts in both the bank robbing group and Spanish Police it's laughable. The two main police/detective characters are the biggest imbeciles you could possibly witness. The firearm/weapon action scenes throughout the series are so over the top and unbelievable it personally prevents me from giving this a 9/10. Honestly Tokio/Tokyo (main character) manages to hit targets with her back turned, running backwards and single handed. The show would have been fantastic if they hired a firearms advisor.All in all I would suggest giving this series a go if you have a few hours to kill. The characters Arturo and Angel are so pathetic it's honestly fascinating to watch them spiral out of control.",Money_heist

3100,pritomg,highly over-rated and highly flawed,4/10,5 April 2020,Who are these people who rated it 8+...i am astonished. This series doesnt even deserve 7.5/10. the writer screwd up a good plot...it shows that the professor is the only intelligent character and all others around him are damn fools. How on earth can a chief investigator be used so meticulously. Most of the tricks that the professor played dont even have 30% chance of actually happening in a actual world. The professor acts more like a prophet or a magician. Most scenes are to fill the time slots n the rest to somehow pave the way to another episode. many low rated tv series are much much better n more sensible and praticable.,Money_heist
3101,swissmaster,nothing special here !!!! plot holes and unbelievable escapes make it even more ridiculous,6/10,21 September 2020,"I didn't want to watch it but my friends and cousin brothers recommended it so I finally gave it a try.
and man was I disappointed or what. Actually, it started good the plan was interesting enough and there were things to keep you watching. but as the show progressed it started to become absurd.
The decisions taken by police and swat officials were laughable and mind numbing. Professor is superman and everyone else is just kids who were born yesterday.
My opinion: Don't watch it there are a lot of better shows out there try them. Emmy Awards have been announced try those shows.

3104,gelenecelis,"Well-written, great character development and depth, excellent staging and editing!",9/10,20 August 2019,"This show feels like theatre, packaged.
I think the bad reviews give it the thumbs down because they're expecting a more modern/moderate approach to cinema.
I agree, plenty things are pretty dramatic, exaggerated (in terms of emotional reactions), and the characters along with the plot follow a ""normal"" fairly formulaic, arguably predictable, story arc.
...but I love that the characters are named semi-anonymously because doing so objectifies them by labeling and strips people off the complexity of our humanity. Having said that, this show exposes itself of the flaws of having one-dimensional characters by using its own characters interact with one another and get to know them deeper than the roles they have, in the given context while still in the act.
The pacing of the acting along with the editing, too, is astounding. The actors act with their eyes, own their respective characters' personalities while showing that they act differently around various scenarios and people.
Many decades ago, fast cutting in editing was frowned upon although many avant-garde filmmakers were already using it (mainstream tends to be behind with these things). It wasn't until later that it became common although I find that too many productions overuse it (montage sequences, which aren't all that bad, which isn't very often)... but when you give it just slivers within the right moments to depict an emotional and mental state of the characters in given stressful or ecstatic moments? Brilliant.
It also mixes the old (folk European music sang by the robbers when they were rejoicing about finding soil) and the new (technology, costumes & wardrobe, shot in present time), politics and how scandals/heists come into play with diplomacy...
I can go on and on about how much I love it both for the eye candy and the socially charged messages (meat) but I think you should go check it out yourself and see if you agree or disagree =)",Money_heist

I liked all of the twists and turns and I thought the actors gave some strong performances. I especially liked √Ålvaro Morte as the Professor. It is true that some of the plot is a bit unrealistic, but I still found it captivating. I have to say that I felt like the second season had a great ending and that they should have left it at that. I will probably watch season 3 anyway, but I don't think that it will top the first two.

3122,jbuaroy,La casa de perfecto,9/10,10 December 2018,"Twists and turns. Action and drama. Love and be loved. Hate, and still be loved. This story has almost everything. OK, a few unrealistic moments. I mean - how many rounds does a magazine really hold? And how bad are trained snipers at hitting a target? That, and a few unlikely turn of events (which I will not spoil for you) aside - this is a magnificent story, accompanied by brilliant acting! Please give me more of this!

The plot twists/ the anticipation/ direction/ oh boy 9/10.Professor gave justice to his role. What a legend. You'll get addicted to the show and you'll start admiring some characters while hating the others. Seriously I got so much involved in the show that I started cursing some of the characters.

These are certainly bots.I told my wife, this series is so poorly written and directed, that it's like they had in mind an audience that doesn't question anything and is content by being spoon-fed cliches and ridiculous mini-cliffhangers in each episode, you know, like our moms and aunts, a non-critical audience that doesn't know any better.This is truly a waste of time and the high ratings are evidently the result of tampering, DO NOT BELIEVE ANY RATING ABOVE 5 STARS.",Money_heist

3149,abdalladamfashi,Not the greatest heist series ever,6/10,10 April 2020,"There's no better time to watch season of this epic heist series. With quarantine and everything going in the world, it won't hurt to watch something exciting. In fact, it would hurt to NOT do something exciting.Season 4Episode 1: At this stage we're just happy to continue watching the series, and get the chance to witness the cliffhanger left in the previous episode. Apart from Berlin's song (highlight of the episode for sure), and the professor's colorful display of emotions Tokyo's guts (she's always full of em), I would say pretty much forgettable.Episode 2: Where the plan starts going downhill, largely due to Palermo's doing. And between his subtle but effective start of a character transformation, to Denver's love troubles and some Jaw breaking moments (literally) between Marseille and the professor, I'd say pretty much interesting all round and Promising, (Apart from Arturo's disgusting presence that is.) Signs of things to come.
Episode 3: Finally, the reemergence of the Professor we all fell in love with. Tokyo at her peak, her vulgar remarks making the episode more interesting, Some worthy quotes and superb dialogues and finally a cliffhanger worth the wait. Impressive, bar the beating up of 'the fat guy' in the bathroom scene which is totally unnecessary.Episode 4: Some highly choreographed action scenes. Delightful watching Stockholm's demonstration of leadership skills. Some top notch performances and exchange by Gandia and Berlin. The scene about the business of managing the economic crisis was gotten wrong, if you ask me. The beginning of the of Sierra's character evolution. Stellar performances and pretty much enjoyable, except the mere presence of Arturo which is meant to deepen our disdain for him. And it did.Episode 5: One of the most brilliantly written and intensely packed episode. From nice action scenes to a semblance of emotional connection and full of surprise. Between Tokyo's exchange with Gandia, and that exquisite Nairobi's pose? We wouldn't have wish for a better episode.
Episode 6. Nairobi's big re
veal kind of spoil her impending doom, which makes it less emotional when it finally arrived. A pivotal change in the relationship between Denver and Stockholm's relationship, maybe for the better. Brilliant planning (as always) by the professor who so far seems to have been dozing. Moving.7. The whole team Still a little bit weary from the death of Nairobi. A befitting tribute to Nairobi. Subtle show of emotion by Sierra. Apart from the suspense at the end? Tiring.8: The most marvelously written and acted episode and the one for Major reveals. From a pivotal change in the image of Palermo (probably to sacrifice him later on), Sierra's bombshell and once again a remarkable show of leadership by Stockholm, a departure from the woman we saw being manipulated by Arturo in the start of the Series. Oh and perhaps a nail in the coffin for her relationship with Denver. Once again an uninspiring attempt of evoking our emotions. Finally, a worthy match to the professor in Sierra, though credit must be given for his articulate planning of the rescue mission. A delightful performance by Manila and perhaps we'll get to see more of her in coming episodes. Not much of a cliffhanger at the end though. I mean we all know Sierra won't do anything rash seeing as she is a persona non grata herself but will instead switch to her own best trait; negotiations. An undeserving end to Gandia too. Apart from those, what an intensely charged and highly choreographed episode! Memorable.In conclusion; Largely shallow plot details, but we can't help but marvel at the depth of the character transformations. Now that we seemingly understand Palermo's plight, we might even come to empathize with him. One can't help but get enthralled with Rio's boyish charm and innocence, and impressed with Stockholm's leadership streak (future heist leader?) and be saddened by Lisbon's growing irrelevance and the professor's seeming aloofness (which says a lot about how the heist might ultimately come to fail) and Tokyo's...well Tokyo being Tokyo. And Arturo, really? To think that we though a character couldn't be more despicable. Throw in another two more seasons with this below par performance, and they just might lose their fan base.",Money_heist

i've seen is when the robbers go to negotiate with colonel and when they get back inside the bank they walk into argument
between Gandia and Bogota they start fighting and fuc*ing hostages take the guns that they just left laying there...

More time we spend watching it,more money the make on it.The idea itself is brilliant but making a soap opera out it just ruinned everything.A lot of nonsense conversations and stupid actions just pull a few more series))).Again the idea was just great,but got to a soap opera in the end...

3173,dbarnes-94914,Promising plot let down by poor subtitles,4/10,2 April 2018,"The series starts well, a plot to pull off a spectacular robbery. However the whole thing is letdown by the subtitles. I like to watch foreign (to me) ie non-English films and tv series, in the original language. This seems to have had its subtitles translated by google as they are often clunky and bear no relation either to the original Spanish or to the English audio also provided. An example, where the chief police negotiator refers to the robbers as ""heist men"". Really? Could the producers not have found fluent translators to have written this stuff?
Later on it gets cliched with cookie-cutter plot lines and twists. Halfway through I am at the point where it would be as tedious to stop as go on, so I shall battle on, if only to see who's left standing at the end.

3176,elias_t,It could be watched as a parody,1/10,19 September 2018,"My first review here. And only because I was lured by some friends to watch it.Well, you know the feeling you have, when you start to want all the protagonists to die? In this series this is what you will think most of the time if you don't fall asleep.Most of the things are done childish wrong because this suited the script writers. You can see this in every episode.You are hyped to see this genius plan by this genius ""professor"" and what you get is a soap opera with deux ex machina that saves the day.The professor is not only a ""genius"", he is also a kind of super agent that can solve any critical mistake in a matter of minutes or even seconds.I believe there is no point to start numbering the obvious plot holes. It would take 10 pages at least.The hardened (teenage looking) pro robbers have no issues to come in sexual relations with the hostages. Really? I thought they are all committed to their cause driven by personal dramas that would make them work like a machine.
What you get is teenage behavior that would make this story end badly for them in episode 1.The most ridiculous scene so far was this one: There is a robber-girl (Nairobi) that is telling her drama at Tokyo. (She lost her child and now wants the heist to succeed so she can get it back.) She is crying and very depressed.
And what they are doing next? They are drinking Tequila, get dressed like they would go out to lure men, start twerking and slap each other's asses.Nice.",Money_heist

I really enjoyed it.Of course at the same time in your head you will be thinking..... why don't the police just do this? why on earth is this person so utterly incompetent? (both police and robbers).But let that go and the show thoroughly deserves its place as the most watched non-English show in the history of Netflix.Hugely recommended

However, due to the huge success, they decided to make another season and while it still has fun moments, it's not great anymore, I'd personally not even call it good. The characters are not believable anymore, everything feels extremely forced. While the first heist certainly had moments where I thought to myself: ""Why in gods name are these people behaving like idiots?"", in the second heist I rarely find myself watching a single episode without cringing at their dumb, erratic behavior.Another huge issue are the action sequences, especially in Season 4 episodes 5 and 6. They are just horrible. About as realistic as action scenes in Fast and Furious or Transformers ... but cheap looking. Completely ridiculous.Overall, the huge decline in quality made me pretty much lose all interest I had in the show. 6/10 just because the first heist was very fun.",Money_heist

3203,jensenbremer,Part 4,8/10,6 April 2020,"It is imperative that in any TV show that when you stretch out the story that it often gets sillier or you try to repeat the formula that made it successful in the first place.The second heist did just that, it was a more difficult heist with higher stakes and the problems they faced were bit of a stretch on the imagination [e.g. Palermo healing quickly after getting glassed in the face, a nearly invincible head of security, Professor boxing in the middle of a problem, finding the person who tortured Rio and making him confess nonchalantly, and Lisbon's escape plan is just silly (although the fake wall was clever)]I must say, without the problems they faced and often silly contingencies, the plan so far is amazing, it's almost like a really good Ocean's heist movie. Part 3 did really well in setting up and showing the technicality of the heist.Part 4 I would roughly say is mostly flashbacks and 2 steps back on the whole series. I would agree with most people who didn't like part 4.But here's why I still gave it an 8: despite the silliness, the drama, the character development and the payoffs are what keeps you on the edge.e.g. Palermo's arc is amazing and drew parallels to Berlin's rise/fall/redemption and his relationship development with Helsinki, Sierra's feistiness and problem solving nearly matches the Professor, Denver/Stockholm ups and downs,and my favorite: they know how to kill off a character properly. first, the head of security promised it and did it in a kind of expected but slow motion build up that makes you nervous. Second, the other characters mourning was given enough time so she doesn't just die and everyone moves on. Nope, they mourn long enough with you. Third, the payoff was great, to use her death as what they called ""a missile"" and the throwback tribute they gave to her, Moscow, Berlin, and Oslo.",Money_heist

A simple Wikipedia search is still more accurate. Example: in part 1 when the ambassadors daughter points the rifle at Rio, there is no magazine in it. She claimed to be an experienced hunter with her father, her form is decent, but all tough she says there's still one in the chamber and proceeds to pull the charging handle back. If there was one in the head it would have been ejected from the chamber. Typical Hollywood making movies with firearms who have never even held one no less shot one. Also, some of the ""developments"" are just too ridiculous. First 2 seasons are somewhat entertaining. Not something I would watch again or go crazy over.",Money_heist

The rescue of Tokyo and the escape of the professor from the inspector,the shootout scene when Tokyo gets back inside using the police motorcycle is the worst of them.",Money_heist
3214,edinehusic,Perfect for killing some time,6/10,6 April 2020,"Series is quite fine if you want to watch an ok show, but don't expect anything magical. It is basically a classic Spanish teen series with respect to the personal relationships between characters. To that add smart ad-hoc tricks, and some ""fight against the government""/""we versus them ""in the mix and you get a quite entertaining soapy series.

3219,catalinitu,Where does the hype come from?!,2/10,13 April 2020,"I've started watching this as the idea sounded interesting with quite some potential when seeing a series filmed in Europe. But, my God, the characters do loose touch with reality and common sense already during season one. By mid season two I could no longer see this. In all honesty, do we really have to have the ""bad guys"" completely useless when enforcing something, taking revenge or even facing each other? Do we really have all the women in this series falling flat on their backs, in love with the perps? And does the Spanish Police, in real life, act like this? Meaning...will an arrest happen when the perp surrenders as he gets bored from being caught 10x? Another soap opera that disappoints more by creating actually an expectation to get something different...",Money_heist
3220,davidkoetschau,"Season 1 and 2 is really good, but than it becomes too unrealistic",8/10,30 July 2019,"It is a very good show, especially seeing it as being from Spain. I read that this is Netflix most watched non-US production.The actors are really great and charismatic. I love the mastermind behind the robbery. I gave it a 9/10 when I was close to the finish of season 2. But than it became more and more unrealistic. Especially in Season 3 it cannot hold up to the standards set before. So I only can give a 7/10 so far for Season 3. (still 2 Episodes left to watch). So I downgraded my vote to 8/10 overall now.Still something worth watching.

This one has came up with a new idea of how a brilliant and a well-structure planned of bank robbery is succeed. In the end show of each episodes, I am truly amazed of how it linked between each episodes and unexpected story of how the situation of the robbers ends in glory. Indeed, what is the most impressive one is that the bad sides (the robbers) always step one ahead from good sides (the police).Lastly, anyone who has spare time: please, download this series and watch it continuously! you won't regret seeing this 10/10 rating series and excellent plot stories.

3227,montoroy,Bella Ciao Bella Ciao Bella Ciao Ciao Ciao,8/10,2 May 2020,"Watched this Spanish series last week.thankyou Netflix, have to say that Season 1 and 2 are Excellent. I loved the role of Professor, Nairobi, and Berlin. The plot is superb and keeps you on the edge of your seat.
.
Characters are superb and all actors have done a good job. With the way it ended in season 2 the expectations for season 3 and 4 were set high as everyone knows, there will be someone somewhere making some mistake. So, yeah I was ready for it.BUT the 3rd and 4th seasons of the series ended up failing the expectation. Maybe because the plan was flawed and not set by the professor. So might be they made it look crazy?
.
The bar scenes from the past between Professor, Berlin, and Palermo were felt a bit stretchy. Arturo was not at all required but don't know if he will be utilized properly in upcoming seasons?Of course, there was a need to kill someone but WHY Nairobi? Maybe the character had grown strong and popular, so they thought to shock the audience? Just like #GOT may be... But then eliminating Monica could have been better as no one knows about her past (to increase emotional attachment of the character, director could have build the character and killed it) and that she was pregnant! Would have sent equal shockwaves.Too many bullets were fired on Gandia but none of it hit his prone body parts. Was he wearing bulletproof pant? What about the head? Ok, agree that the director did not want the Heist team to kill any civilian because then it would have turned them from thieves to murderers but a bullet on legs or arms could have done the work.Hopefully, they come up with better execution of the plot in season 5 and 6 and maintain or exceed the expectation which was set by season 1 & 2. But please give a beautiful and logical ending to the series in season 6. I won't mind if the series ends in Season 5. Thing is that don't drag to make it lose its charm.",Money_heist

3237,orangeyellowwhite,Season 1-2 Review,3/10,5 May 2020,"This series has so many problems that I just can't sit still and watch.
The robbers behave so unprofessionally that they can't do anything right. They can't scare the hostages to be afraid, they can't control them. They have their phone and weapons stolen, they run away from them - but there is no punishment for that, the hostages go on and look for something else to do, because the robbers see nothing - they are happy that they are robbing something and have a weapon that is directed against them. The robbers do not listen to each other, can not work in a team and help each other, behave pathetically but it does not give them anything. Focus on love, not on how things go.
The series is more suitable for teenage drama than for something serious.

This series is for you!,3/10,18 July 2018,"Upfront: this is a Spanish series, and I'm an American who watched this on Netflix with the English dubbed over. It's likely much more appealing in Latin markets, but missed the mark for me. The initial few episodes are intriguing, as they set-up what appears to be a relatively intelligent heist series. What develops is a melodramatic soap opera with pathetic character development and plot holes galore. If you enjoy mindless afternoon soaps, this series is for you. If you're looking for an intelligent crime thriller, do not let the first episode sell you like it did me. I'm disappointed in myself for having wasted the 20 or so hours and laughed at 90% of Season 2 to get myself through to the end.

Now I know why even Spaniards don't like this series, it's rubbish. only third world countries love this series with their third world sensation. I don't wonder why the ratings are high, third world people really like this kind of trash.

The writing is as poor as it gets and it requires you to completely suspend your reason and logic in order to follow the plot. I personally found myself unable to sympathize with any of the characters, they are badly done and none of them is even remotely smart or complex.

In some parts of the show, I feel like everything's going according to the plan too well, everything's too smart and too good to be true. It goes on like this for a moment. But then that's where the show gets amazing, they start making fails. Their mistakes make you connect with the characters. We see their professional thief sides and their humany, secret sides. We learn their stories. It's definetely worth watching. It's not like one of those puzzle-crime shows. You don't have to push your brain's limit to guess anything.

1) It is wayyy too long. You could've told the story in one season that they've told in two. 2) It has way too many plot holes, unrealistic developments as well as unrealistic single scenes - the leading officers seem to be the slowest and most short-thinking people on the planet. I don't want to spoil any so I'll leave it with that.3) the English syncs are so bad it hurts. Starting with the fact that they call the guy ""Angel"" instead of ""√Ängel"". The leading officers sound like post-pubertarian kids instead of grown-up inspectors in charge of the biggest heist in Spanish history. I'm pretty pissed I wasted that much of my time.

I watched both season's,it is a good show but no more. Its predictable enough and it does not even seem real in many cases(example. The Cop Shootout ,all that shooting all that bullets and only 1 got hurt after a lot of time, its like the cops random shooted) In other words there is no element of violence in a armed heist,the main actors are not even afraid of a gun pointing in their head, clearly dont get me wrong this show is good but not even close to shows like Vikings,Breaking Bad,Game of Thrones,The last kingdom , the show deserves a rating below 7.9/10 its a shame that it surpasses Vikings rating, I just feel the target audience for this show is young aged that give those ratings.
Rating for Casa de papel 7/10

3276,sreshta-02155,Great until they decided to continue it,1/10,10 November 2020,"Season 1 was great with the first robbery but as the show progressed it was apparent that there was no content left to drag and felt unessacery. Everything after the first heist was a pain to watch and should not have been there. Watch the first heist and then STOP.

It's one of the best series that I have seen lately.
A chess game between the police and the robbers, you will be surprised by its development.
You can not foresee anything.

3283,ryanleemartinart,Very drawing plot with a few points on the nose,9/10,12 January 2018,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first season currently out, and while I generally felt satisfied with the events of the plot, there are certain points where it felt the plot got into a corner and the writers just added flashbacks in order to say that the mastermind accounted for everything. It's convincing in the way his character is portrayed, but laughable at some points. Also the closing line of the first episode almost made me not want to watch the series due to how cringy it is. Don't be dissuaded, this is a very well written story showing perspectives of the hostages and how they view events even though the audience knows differently. They don't keep the audience in the blind and allow the audience to truly feel a step ahead of the police along with the gang. I would definitely recommend watching at least the season that is currently available.

One season would have been enough for this series, but as S2 started you could feel that soap opera vibe it had. It was absoluetly unrealistic and over dramatized. They should've ended after 2 seasons. S3 and S4 is just boring and unnecessary and as I said it's just a big soap opera. Painful to watch.

I'm not sure if this has lead to me missing some vibes because some of the storylines and relationships just appear out of nowhere.I thought this might be a bit of a quirky series to watch, but it just ended up trying to work out what's actually going on. I wasn't sure if I was watching a serious heist series or if it was some kind of joke. The whole heist theme is pretty much irrelevant and is just something to give this series a title.The first episodes make you think all of the team have been specially selected for their skills, but they all end up just being idiots.Having said that I can't stop watching it even though I have very little idea of what's going Because the whole thing is dubbed over I can just say that's why it didn't make sense.",Money_heist

the show calls you for the plottwist and the drama but there is like only 2/3 things that happens that you will think ""damn nice..."" the rest is only them arguing and pointing themselves with the guns lol. the ending is cliche and the story plot has many fails.
its sad because it had potencial but they just downhill the show.

3298,aysheylmaz,A Socialist Message,10/10,6 February 2018,"This series gives a lot of great messages. First of all, Dali masks are not an ordinary choice. Dali is a genius painter who inherits community life contrary to moral and common traditions. He never accepted the society's obligations and the right to misuse ethical rules. The masks represent this irregularity.
The red overalls represent socialism (communism). The thiefs are socialist comrades and they are fighting.
The royal mint and cops represent capitalism. In capitalism money makes everything. Even morality will make money. When someone attacks the money, these people are declared bad. Here they are attacking money. When it is attacked by money, capitalism is fighting against the aggressors through armed and visual means.
The professor symbolizes the scientific point of view and accounting. In the end, scientific thinking and responsibility come from the top of all kinds of problems. But he succumbs love.
I have not seen such a meaningful socialism in a long time. Moreover, the plot was used by the Salvador Dali tactic. You think you're watching the events, but each time you have a deep meaning and a message.
Berlin is a sort of socialist struggle that is on the verge of resistance to the death scene and that it leads and hand in hand with the woman. The song Ciao Bella also symbolizes socialism.
Great job. It's not just a movie or a script. It is a wonderful work as a philosophy. There is a big slap in the capitalist system.",Money_heist

Except of one thing makes this series unbeliveable: The opponents are also smart. I never say ""Oh no why they can't understand bla bla bla"" or like this something. Just enjoyed with fiction and chill.Talk about Dali(masks), common point Dali and Professor's squad is both of them don't accept big brothers system, ethic is relative each person. Raquel Murillo seems like affected 2. season final by Professor, after European Central Bank talk she helped Professor, yes it was about relationship about them but this was a near point i think, just a comment from me. And last comment about Dali and all other ideological opinion, this ideology in series is not socialism it is revolt to system.""Si is importante, puedes usar el m√≠o""",Money_heist

Certainly the most impressive thing in the series is the plan that Professor created and the things that he knows and the ones he made up out of the blue. 
 Beyond the violence and the desire to steal the money, the series talk a lot about love, and forbidden love. A philosophy that the series shows is that in some cases love ruins everything because some people could not get involved, but some of them do, and this can be really bad for the plan.
 One thing that is really commented in the series is about how family is important; how some people can lose their minds if they do not have a present family and how people can fix their minds too with someone of his family by their side.
 In general this series is fantastic and really original, some of the things that happen there I would never have been able to think about by myself. I really recommend it.

3303,hllcnkoe,Forced suspense to get watchers hooked and damaging gender stereotypes,1/10,21 February 2018,"The show has its merits. The camera work and aesthetics are very well taken care of. I enjoyed it as a visual experience.
The problem are the characters and the story.
In a similar way to the TV series ""Lost"", at the end of each episode there's a forced suspence-generating situation. This is not bad per se. What I didn't like is that the suspense situations most times get resolved quickly in the next chapter and in an absurd way, in a deus ex machina style, without any intelligent plot integration.
About the characters, I found most of them very irritating. Many times during the show I thought ""how silly/ridiculous is what he/she's doing!"".
Most women are depicted as impulsive and irrational, and only men display an adult use of their brain without the interference of their hormones. This promotes gender stereotypes. Why can't women think coldly and rationally? The main female inspector is particularly irrational and careless about respecting police protocols.

Acting is very good but...the plot is not. Most of the robbers reactions are stupid. If what you want is watching high quality content don't watch this. There's no social criticism or whatever...really.SPOILER : Tokyo's voice over will spoil the end of the show on episode 1 in the first minutes.

3308,freedomliberator,what a fun ride - one of most entertaining shows to date,9/10,2 March 2018,"I've read some silly negative reviews so I've felt compelled to write something for those who can't decide whether to watch or not and who might have given too much importance to otherwise lacking negative reviews of the show here. This show does not take itself seriously and that's its strongest point and that's why it's easy to forgive so many things that would be unforgivable if the show was made under pretense of a serious ""perfect"" heist of the century. if you expect such show you better skip this one - it's not for you - you'll be disappointed...most likely. All the main characters are broken and vulnerable people with a number of personality quirks, they are really caricatures of the professional master criminals. You could say that the show to some extent in that aspect parodies the genre especially movies and shows made in the US. There is no such thing as a perfect plan, it's human to err, it's human to love and fall in love, to sin and seek redemption. It's good when the show made in Spain gets soapy and adds some of that special Latin Telenovela flair to the suspense of the series. Well tempered melodramatic parts of the show work really well with playful cast who have obviously enjoyed themselves while on the set.The music theme of the show ""My life is going on"" explains the crux of the narrative.
it's a love story wrapped in the heist inside The House of Paper. ;)",Money_heist

3312,alexjones-71384,Intense all the way through!,10/10,5 March 2018,"For a theme that has been widely covered in movies and shows, Lacasa De Papel is refreshingly unique. Any fan of Prison break or shows of that ilk will enjoy the intricacies of the plot and the intensity of this show. Every show has its flaws, and while there are some unrealistic moments, it is still an enjoyable watch. The acting was phenomenal, (big up to Pedro alonso for his part as Berlin) the plot was exciting and unpredictable and the action itself was thouroughly entertaining. 
This show had so many twists and turns that even in the episodes where not a lot was happening, I was on edge because there was just no way to tell what was going to happen next.The reviews bashing this show are mostly about slight innaccuracies and minor plotholes, don't listen to them. Listen to me. Lacasa de papel is intense, emotional, and action packed. One of the top 3 shows I have watched for sure, and I generally don't enjoy movies/shows in other languages. The only thing I would say is if you plan on watching this show, don't watch it English dubbed, it takes a lot away from the brilliant acting. Use English subtitles instead! Enjoy!

3315,aminelahloumi,Enjoyed it,8/10,11 March 2018,"Leaving out the fact that this, is one of the greatest things Spain ever made (after some horror films), I must say that I wasn't fully satisfied about some logics during the episodes. ""El Professor"" obviously was the most intelligent character of the series, but some dynamics they were left to chance. Fortunatly, everything ended up to his advantage, but I hoped that nothing was by chance, like I said. Apart from that, the final left me a little bit down, like many others because during the episodes they made me fond of the characters for leaving me with too many questions. Anyway, I really enjoyed it and hope it's not the last season!

If you watch it with an analytical mind (having some basic understanding about the world history and culture helps) you will go crazy.There is so many cliches, (from phrases, to historical events, music, etc), its just insulting at some point. Every cliche you can think of, cliche phrase, cliche term was used in this show. You will notice those.But then again, some normal behavior is altered to fit the story and to fit the events. There are so many different, completely unnatural reactions in the movie, that would absolutely never be possible in real life.Police in the show, represented somewhat negatively, are just plain stupid and naive. I dont see any other reason to make the decisions that theyve done.And this is throughout the whole show. In every episode, i found 10-20 things that annoyed the living hell out of me, frustrated me, and just plainly made me angry for spending time for watching it.If you do watch it, do not overly think or go into analysis ""why, how, what"".

3327,anca_ctin,This is a story of love in all its forms ...to watch season 2 as it will unravel,7/10,28 March 2018,"Having viewed both seasons. - season 2 much more catchy and well developed than the first one, my review is that this series intends to be a powerfull love statement.of course the robbery is what appeals and intrigues everyone but I see it as secondary 
We have father son love between Sergio and his father as he is the one who fulfills his father lifetime plan and also between Moscow and Denver which is a sacrificing love. Also sacrificing love is the one between brothers. I am speaking about the powerfull connection between Sergio and Andres. 
Andres is my favourite character as he shows multiple layers to his personality and the actor is briliant. The last scene with him and the dialogue with sergio is absolutely wonderful and the music is just perfect.
Beside the love for his father he trully has a love for the weakests, for the repressed, as well as Sergio. Their idea was not to get rich for the sake of being rich but to give the world a robin hood feeling, stealing from the rich and so on. The rich being the capitalist society ruled by bankers.
What gives soul to this series and the reason why you cannot quit it even though there are many loopholes that get on your nerve are the love stories. 
Monica and denver is the unforseen love but in 5 days it has everything From hate to love and sex and friendship
Rio and tokio have a disfunctional relationship toxical at some points but nontheless enjoyable 
Season 2 is most about sergio and rachel. The actors deliver the perfect tensional love hate relation
About the theft. Yes there are manyyy many errors related to the techical aspects or the storyline, the scrips that seems stupid or just funny if you view them a bit relaxed but there are also some nice turnarounds events. some more plausable than other, that do the trick and make you want to see more.
My conclusion after this loong review is that the directos do a good job at depicting the characters and thier relations and a mediocre job at the actions that surrounds them, from where the major flaws come from.",Money_heist
3328,yusufbhalliyb,Not good,1/10,5 September 2021,"Encourages robbery and and all sorts of illegal activities in the name of justice, why would anyone steal public money from a bank and take it for themselves instead or giving it to the poor if they call it justice. I wouldn't be surprised if this show bred more burglars and thugs. Also the actors are hypocrites they are Zionists, if they truly are just they should have supported the Palestinian cause.

What I loved about this show is that I just love every character personal story and the friendship they had I know they had a few argument and disagreement but they where like one big family that love each other and I love the romantic relationship between Tokio and Rio. The happiest part about the show when they got away from the Royal Mint and having around 2.4 billion euro to split for ever person who was involved with the heist even know the whole dam police world where looking for them. The saddest part of the show was when they captured Rio and tortured him and beat the hell out of him just to get all the answer out of him in relation of the heist. Another sad part of the show when Nairobi got shot in the head with the gun. I was very sad when she got shot I had an tear in my eye when that happen I want the person who shot Nairobi to get shot and got to hell to what he did to Nairobi but why he was kept alive for the professor plan for operation Paris.

3334,amrakkad-53678,Avoid if you have high standards,3/10,7 April 2018,"Started watching it as everyone else was talking about the show and how fabulous it is, the characters aren't convincing, the story itself is not well-written, the acting can be ridiculous sometimes, many actors have been really heavy on me and so dumb so that I had to skip many scenes only not to get bothered by their appearances, especially the detective, some actors are good, Berlin for example.
overall, I didn't complete it as I found it to be a waste of time, maybe you can do a movie with that story, but a series is too much for it, repeated contents and gaps everywhere, didn't convince me, HIGHLY overrated

3338,taleweaver-06890,Gripping but oh so flawed,7/10,9 April 2018,"""La casa de papel"" is an interesting case: a series that's written to be gripping and exciting yet at the same time doing it in all the wrong ways. It presents itself as the story of ""the perfect heist"" - a robbery so meticulously planned that the only way it could fall apart is if the people executing it botch their jobs really badly.Guess what happens? Six out of the nine people involved botch their jobs badly, including the mastermind.Fortunately, everything works out to the result of maximum suspense. Unfortunately, that happens at the cost of throwing away logic in more than one place. Not that you'd really mind if it were done ironically, or at least with a little self-awareness of the increasingly over-the-top developments. But the series insists on its own seriousness again and again, even when it has clearly gone beyond logic and went into A-Team ridiculousness.What holds this series together is a group of talented actors, if you do not count Tokyo, who seems to know only one facial expression, very much like a female Nicholas Cage, except when she's having a breakdown. All the others sell their scenes convincingly",Money_heist

the director sought to say many things and give many lessons and not a one clear message that inspires the viewer, for example ""breaking bad"" ...all for the family, ""back on the Future"" movie, we build our own future...so what is the lesson?...after to see Casa de Papel..With all conflicts resolved, creating a third season is literally ....burning the paper",Money_heist

3345,randallslick,Impressive and exciting.......but,7/10,20 April 2018,"I have enjoyed Series 1 on Netflix. Good to see the latter putting out European drama at last. However, the excellent plot and cast are let down somewhat by the horrendous dubbing. Seriously, some of the voice-overs are totally wrong and really detract from the pacing of the plot and my understanding of the characters. I really would have benefited from subtitles. Also I don't quite understand why they changed the title. My vague understanding of Spanish leads me to believe that the title is 'Paper House' or similar. Why Money Heist? Sounds imfantile and does a great programme a disservice.

I don't usually like foreign movies because the traduction is bad, but the actors are wonderful and the characters are wonderful. You root for them as the heist goes along, and definitely keeps you on the edge. It is more than just criminals, there is values, rules, morals and definitely sends a bigger message about who the real crooks are in the world.

This show is definitely best watched in original Spanish. It has incredible character diversity, depth and development, with the casting being spot on. Critiques in an excellent manner the over-arching divide between the people and authority, and what drives people to take certain actions.

If you are expecting to see some thriller,action,crime mystery don't waste your time in this mess, unless you want to watch an unbelievable fantasy. A person with Logic & common sense should find it pretty difficult to watch this series. Seemed like God himself planned the heist for them, no matter what the situation always favours the robbers. And the chief of Police is definitely the worst character ever in my opinion. Have seen some spanish movies, its definitely the worst spanish creation i've ever watched. It was pretty hard to continue after the 1st 2 or 3 episodes of season 1, But still watched till season 2. I must say i regret watching this. A thief is a thief. This show portraits thieves as heroes. May convey wrong messege to people.

3363,vasyakishchyk,It is actually painful to watch,2/10,6 January 2021,"I couldn't stand watching even the end of first season.This is something unique,i mean really unique,it's bad in all the ways it could be bad.It's not bad actually,it's awful.I felt physical pain while watching it.I don't know how people can like shows like these,and this disaster have became so popular.
There is nothing to describe,it's simply terrible and pain while watching is not a joke.The cast,plot( it could be interesing if screenwriters weren't drunk or high ).
The whole thing is like some indian movie for 10yo kids.
It's really sad people are watching such TV shows and it gets so overhyped.

3364,Maru16,Don't believe the hype!,3/10,28 October 2018,"After listening to so much praise for Money Heist (La casa de papel), I came into this series with enthusiasm. Unfortunately, that enthusiasm quickly faded after seeing the first episodes. The story seems to have been written with some misogyny, presenting erratic, impulsive and thoughtless female characters, who fail every time they are in charge of anything. It is impossible to empathize with any of the characters, because they are all equally despicable. The lack of plausibility of some facts becomes laughable: elite police sharpshooters who cannot manage to shoot a single criminal, even when they are only a few meters away, and those wounded by bullets who miraculously recover in a few hours.There is a whiff of communism that justifies the robbery of the National Mint, because the banks seem to get richer and richer as the people become poorer and poorer. Actually, it seems that for these modern-day Robin Hoods, the problem was not what the banks were doing; it was merely that they were not the ones doing it. This was their way of achieving ""social justice."" Therefore, they decide to print millions of euros to distribute among themselves, ""the poor wretches"" of the criminal gang. The main protagonist is, without a doubt, a beer company, Estrella Galicia, that accompanies the characters from the beginning to the end. I hope that the third season never arrives. Stay away from it!",Money_heist

BUT.....my friend this series is just different you will see robbers as Hero's.
Each character is just perfect what they are assigned to do.
The strategy, planning, the way professor explain everything it's execution all are just perfect.
Professor- A man with dream and principal
Tokyo- A girl who react on her instinct and just live the way she is
Berlin- best character in season 1

3366,pkenny-07156,Unparalleled Intellectual Suspense,10/10,20 May 2018,"I almost never write reviews, but this show requires one. If you like intellectual suspense, this has to be the best show made in a very long time. The tension between the Professor and the Inspector, as low key as it is on the surface, becomes overwhelming. I found myself routing for both of them, though in truth probably more so for the Professor. It is difficult to convey just how good this show is without revealing too much. When the series finally ended it felt like I just had finished a hard sprint. I now am going to watch for anything with the same writers, directors, and actors. They clearly are an ""A"" team. My only suggestion for the writers and directors - you do not need so much skin in skin scenes or use of the ""F"" word. Both might be commonplace in hollywood, but the phrase ""hollywood standards"" is a term of derision most places outside hollywood.

3368,gcrtrade,Oceans 11 meets George of the Jungle!,1/10,22 May 2018,"I'm stunned at how bad this series is, from the outset it tries too hard to portray that 'cool' image of bank robbers, immortalising them into something they're not. First of all there's zero character development, its straight into the action, no planning, no build up, no suspense. Just straight through the front door all guns blazing, its a terrible plan that is so unbeliebable its literaly unwatchable. Secondly there's the acting, its not just bad, its really bad, it doesn't help that the script is awful too, sounds like its written by the guy who didn't get the job at writing the first Rambo movie.And finally the whole thing is filmed through a gritty filter, washed out colours, dark, moody, but it doesn't create the intended suspense its supposed to, its just annoying. I had to create an account just to vent at how bad this show is. Worst show I've ever seen on Netflix by a country mile.",Money_heist

I though it would be one more of those simple yet fun heist movies without much more involved than the heist itself.However, while watching it you get to understand that this show is more than just a money heist. It becomes an eye-opener about the way our world is run by capitalism and economics. It certainly has a deeper meaning and the makers of this show have found a great way of delivering it to us.There is not much to say about it. Even the actors where great and their acting was so believable that makes me wonder why many of them don't have a career in Hollywood...This show is smart, it delivers great messages, it has great tempo leaving you no time to get bored or anything and you will absolutely feel thankful for watching it!Excuse me for any grammar mistakes, English is not my native language.O bella, ciao! bella, ciao! bella, ciao, ciao, ciao!...",Money_heist

It's very entertaining to watch and the characters have a lot of personality and are very different from eachother.It is refreshing to see a non american show with this quality.

The best part of this tv series is that all cast and crew are originally Spanish and every single person does their jobs perfectly well.
You simply enjoy acting, plot, directing, soundtrack, costume, lighting and everything else you expect from a great work of art.
I watched the first two seasons in English dub and it was really professional you nearly miss the fact that it is a non-English tv series. The third season, however, was in Spanish with English subtitles. It was amazing, too.
That was for sure and by far the best non-English tv series I've ever watched. It's a must-watch.
Just hope that after being owned by Netflix won't lose its great features.

3391,gouthamskmr,Beyaond imagination the lacasa de papel (money heist),10/10,19 April 2020,"Right now it's the best there is. breathtaking, stunning, unpredictable and One word ""Perfect"", Just completed the season 03 of much appreciated the heist series But truly one thing for sure I had never seen heist series with love story between either father and son aur between lovers. This series's theme song is all about the love and ruined.
I will not spoiler the plot but one thing for sure the last four episodes of season 2 on their best and will remind for long time and just it is professor who will amaze you with his incredible acting but finally it was Berlin yes it is berlin who will fill up your eyes with tears. and will capable to take all the credit of the series, end of the day you will fall in love with the bad guys.

3392,lucastlundin,Entertaining but very inconsistent and not credible scens,5/10,24 July 2018,"The series is entertaining. But I can't stand one thing, you are supposed to be amazed and entertained by how smart and well thought out the thieves and the cops are. And this really is not the case when almost every single smart id√© works because of one thing, and in the next episode, they break that one thing or rule that made the trick work. The series is very inconsistent within its own rules regarding the story, and that makes the entire ""smart"" thing broken and less entertaining. In some situations, the thieves have every little detail thought out, and just skip other dilemmas that would be huge problems for the cops and the thieves. When you really want to see whats gonna happen, and how the characters will solve the ongoing small situations, they often cut the scenes and skip forward in time. This feels like a really cheap way to force the story in the specific angle they want it to go, rather than let it play out as it would do in real life. With more interesting dilemmas, emotions and a story which would probably not go in the direction they skipped forward to. A third thing that really waters out the series and makes it much less exciting is the never-ending flow of standoffs that literally leads nowhere. Many times two or more totally different opinions arguing. And they don't come to a collective agreement at all, and still, the story goes on as if they did. Until they reach a new dilemma with different views, and after some fighting, the story goes on as if they all agreed to do the same thing. And a fourth thing that bugged me. The crew that made the entire heist looked like a bunch of incompetent children compared to the squad of serbs that arrive at the end. This really reduces the original crew to zeroes and makes the point of the series regarding uncontrollable emotions look like a simple unprofessional trait. And why would not the professor use the Serb squad for the entire heist?! He had literally 5 months to see that the other team were too emotional and different to be able to cooperate smothly.",Money_heist

So i did... And i was completely disappointed about the really poor writing.
I can sit down and make a list about how many things that had a tremendous effect in the plot, were presented to us as a coincidence or were luckily discovered by the police or the thieves. 
SO MANY DAMN COINCIDENCES ARE THE BEST SIGN TO A BAD WRITING
In my opinion this series is the definition of a scriptwriter which seriously lacks talent or he was damn bored about writing a nice script.

3408,christopherwalker-48060,Disappointed - show goes massively downhill,3/10,7 September 2018,"The show started with promise and the concept was good. The first few episodes were not bad but by the second season it was seriously dragging and I couldn't wait for it to end. I felt like I was invested given that I watched the first series to go to the end but the end actually makes the whole series look much worse1) The professors only mistake was falling in love. What? He made so many mistakes. Why did he start talking to Angel and let him into his factory? Why do he appoint a bunch of morons to do the heist? Why do he only use the Serbs at the end? 2) Most of the characters are morons. The inspector is in the middle of a major heist with national coverage and spends half her day getting coffee or hanging out with a guy she just met. She has a daughter too who she leaves with her Mum with Alzheimers? She also changes her mind every 2 seconds and just because she saw a red hair on his jacket she knew that he was now the killer instead of someone she fell in love with after 2 days? What?3) The romantic relationships were ridiculous. Tokio and Rio makes no sense at all. Monica, supposedly a refined, smart lady falls in love with a total moron after 2 days and then starts shooting at the police officers? Really? The other girl starts sleeping with Berlin because she is scared even though they act like they are all mates half the time and bring them pizzas (from where?)4) How many stand offs can you have? It was obvious they weren't going to shoot anyone so why did they keep pointing guns every two seconds. It loses its meaning when you do it every 2 seconds. Also why did Denver shoot Monica in the leg? He could have just not done that and I think everyone would have been OK with that it was not part of the plan and is very unnecessary.I could go on all day.By the end you hate all of the characters and you will happen they will all take each other out just to end the show and make sure they don't do another series.",Money_heist

3430,marinasuperme,a truly subversive telenovella,10/10,2 November 2018,"Is what this series is. And it is beautiful, in its almost childish naivety which some mistake for lack of skill and logical inconsistencies. Yes, some plot points are ludicrous, the first of which is the basic premise of the series, that it is really possible to rob la Casa de Papel. It is not, otherwise it would have been done in real life and we would know about it. In my opinion, this series is not about a heist. It is about the underprivileged, downtrodden and losers entering the place where money is printed to reveal us that it is essentially what it is called in Spanish - A house of paper. And to show us what they are in their essence - just people who crave for love. Those whose intellect is above such shallowness, seeing only plot holes and cheap melodrama, please explain how on Earth could, for example, Jesse Pinkman phone Walter White and vice versa without getting them both caught? There was no triangulation in Albuquerque? The first time we see the real Heisenberg, when he blows up Tucos headquarters, the series has seriously jumped the shark as both of them are alive and WW gets away with it. The methalamine which was on the train robbed in the best tv series in history and around here, is easily made at home. Does that make BB a bad series? Of course not. The richness of the characters, ethical ambiguity and eternal themes it addresses compensate for minor flaws of the plot. La Casa de Papel does not pretend to be as serious as BB, but it does have a message. A truly humane one. And as subtle and subversive as Bella Ciao. It is the reason why people love this series and come here to recommend it to others. Not because they are paid. Money is paper, after all. Even Walter White had to acknowledge that fact in the end.",Money_heist

3436,janstocker,Almost Surprising Over Two Seasons,9/10,16 November 2018,"It's a very surprising TV show because at the beginning you can't imagine that the bank robbery will be over two seasons. Every series is enjoyable with a cliffhanger at the end. The story isn't predictable and that is fascinating. I think at the end the story is a little bit drawn-out. The TV show should be shorter to make it perfect.
Overall I think it is a hilarious TV show.

3437,janbkubik,The Golden Rule of the Heist...,6/10,17 August 2019,"Is to Buy Time. And boy, does this series do it. Season One crawls along, and instead of wrapping up everything in a nice little bow by Episode 13, nah, fooled you, we're gonna continue on, and on, and on. So many Suspension of Doubt in the story-- like the Professor somehow hooking up with Raquel, lead investigator on the case. Or Denver hooking up with Monica-- as if Stockholm Syndrome pops up in a few days, esp. after the victim has been shot in the leg, after learning she is pregnant by the wimping min director who first says he has no intention of leaving his wife and three kids, only to suddenly say, yeah, Monica, you're the one for me.
If this had wrapped up after one season, I would have written it off and said, okay, some good, some bad, but not worth watching the remaining two Seasons.
Not sure why it is rated so highly. The script and plot lines should have been edited with a weed hacker.
This is like The Never Ending Story, it just keeps going on, and on, and on...Should have ended after about ten episodes.

3451,tossflorin,waste of time,1/10,5 December 2021,"This series insults the viewer's intelligence. How the hell do two wounds heal in 48 hours? And on top of that, a hostage also has sex even if her leg was injured. And the police only had a smoke grenade, and where from did the robers get the piece of metal to cover the hole and the welding machine? Many inconsistencies: Monica wore white lingerie, then appeared in black lingerie.WEAK, VERY WEAK.

3452,jsiegelaar,Don't waste your time on this!!!!,1/10,7 February 2019,"Either most critics lack basic brain functions, or most critics were paid. I can not imagine any serious intelligent adult who would actually finish watching this series, look back, and then rate it anything above above 2/10. I mean... seriously!
If you are still watching it, thinking it will get better, more logical, pieces will come together: it won't and they won't. Nonsensical until the very end. Do yourself a favour, and watch anything else instead.Only one example: how could Raquel let the Professor escape TWICE while holding him at gunpoint? She never considers calling her colleagues? Do the right and logical thing: solving the kidnap? Or do the writers suggest she fails to take him in, because she subconsciously loves him under her raging anger, and therefore fails more or less intentionally??? Please, do not insult any viewers with more than two brain cells...Netflix, I am dissappointed: with the series and with the rating system. Pffff....",Money_heist
3453,xoolfi-12064,Unconvincing and Weak Onesided Storyline,1/10,28 September 2019,"Somehow on a beautiful plot they were able to mess up the story line. It seems like the guns police have are not working, and the police dog can't smell, making everything one sided without any logic or proper reasoning. I am rather mad on this than disappointed.

3455,smanikandan-76588,MANY MISTAKES IN 2ND HEIST,5/10,19 May 2021,"Main Reason is that irritating character Arturo .. He created many trouble in 1st heist and why did they simply throw out him or tied separated from other that's a very bad idea from a brilliant man as professor ... And Killing Nairobi while Six men having their Guns ready and the Guard just telling some dialogues before killing and escaped easily.... It's just not been realistic for a series which is based on a realistic mode....

3456,honestx,"My friend forced me to watch this, who was tricked by the reviews",1/10,14 February 2019,"First things first!
Ratings do matter.
My friend, who trusts IMDb ratings, found out that La casa de papel has got a fair amount of 10s and thought that it's a good film series to watch. But boy he was mistaken.
Let's start from the fact, that these robbers are not smart, but very stupid and incompetent indeed. Main character, Tokyo is so stupid and acts like she's got no experience in her criminal life. In the very first series, she almost makes a mistake, which even I would not do.
The series is full of nonsense, if a human gets shot millions of bullets, one should die, right? hm.. not in this series..
Why would I even want to watch this silly stuff? I still finished it hoping that it would be interesting at the end. I was still mistaken.

How the director/creator put this together just amazes me that there's that level of brilliance out there somewhere. It's a series that will make you feel every emotion. It's a series that will make you click next episode even though you know you should be getting to bed. It's the only series that not only I've written a review for, but going to watch all over again, right away.

3458,cricketplayerngp,Money Heist Season 4 Review,9/10,18 April 2020,"Palermo,this is a war,act accordingly"" are the last words we hear the Professor say during the end of season 3.All money heist fans undoubtedly remember these words.Since 8 months,all the fans are preparing to take part in this war by simply sitting in pyjamas and binge watching season 4.Finally,season 4 has released on Netflix and I have finished watching the entire season.
Season 4 starts off with heaps of tension and drama as Nairobi's condition is critical and the Professor has lost his mind due to the well-planned fake execution of Lisbon on the orders of Sierra.Nothing seems to be going according to the plan.All the robbers are in a worrisome situation as the Professor is not able to come up with a new plan which has never happened before.Meanwhile,Inspector Sierra is on the top of her game and all the moves are hitting the bulls eye.
It is ironic that the series is presented in such a way that we root for the bad guys and curse the people who are trying to catch/kill the robbers.This is what makes the series special.Each and every character has an unique personality and the character arcs are beautifully drawn.The writer successfully writes an almost flawless script for season 4.All the actors manage to pull of an amazing performance.
Money Heist is not just a series,it is an emotion for its fans.Thus,the expectations automatically sky-rocketed for Season 4.I can confidently say that Season 4 lives up to its expectations.It does not have a single boring moment.All said and done Season 4 of Money Heist is a perfect blend of tension,drama,action,emotions,cheap thrills and dark humor.Like the first three seasons,Season 4 is also a masterpiece.Don't miss it.Ratings-4.5/5Guys this is my first review so kindly ignore some flaws.Let me know if you found it helpful",Money_heist

3465,kfeshari,Difficult task for the writers,9/10,23 July 2019,"After the ending of Part 2 of the series, I was uncertain about how the story would turn in the coming parts. As expected the writers were faced with many loose ends and holes that needed to be filled in the new season. Although noticable, it was done well. The plot is similar yet different than what weve seen before giving it a refreshing feel to the series. Well done overall.
